[["In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.","He was in the beginning with God.","All things came into being through Him, and apart from Him not one thing came into being which has come into being.","In Him was life, and the life was the light of men.","And the light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not overcome it.","There came a man sent from God, whose name was John.","He came for a testimony that he might testify concerning the light, that all might believe through him.","He was not the light, but came that he might testify concerning the light.","This was the true light which, coming into the world, enlightens every man.","He was in the world, and the world came into being through Him, yet the world did not know Him.","He came to His own, yet those who were His own did not receive Him.","But as many as received Him, to them He gave the authority to become children of God, to those who believe into His name,","Who were begotten not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.","And the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us (and we beheld His glory, glory as of the only Begotten from the Father), full of grace and reality.","John testified concerning Him and cried out, saying, This was He of whom I said, He who is coming after me has become ahead of me, because He was before me.","For of His fullness we have all received, and grace upon grace.","For the law was given through Moses; grace and reality came through Jesus Christ.","No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him.","And this is the testimony of John, when the Jews sent to him priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, Who are you?","And he confessed and did not deny, and he confessed, I am not the Christ.","And they asked him, What then? Are you Elijah? And he said, I am not. Are you the Prophet? And he answered, No.","They said then to him, Who are you, that we may give an answer to those who sent us? What do you say about yourself?","He said, I am “a voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord!” as Isaiah the prophet said.","And those who had been sent were of the Pharisees.","And they asked him and said to him, Why then are you baptizing if you are not the Christ nor Elijah nor the Prophet?","John answered them, saying, I baptize in water; but among you stands One whom you do not know,","He who is coming after me, the thong of whose sandal I am not worthy to untie.","These things took place in Bethany across the Jordan, where John was baptizing.","The next day he saw Jesus coming to him and said, Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!","This is He of whom I said, A man is coming after me who has become ahead of me, because He was before me.","And I did not know Him, but in order that He might be manifested to Israel, for this reason I came baptizing in water.","And John testified, saying, I beheld the Spirit descending as a dove out of heaven, and He abode upon Him.","And I did not know Him, but He who sent me to baptize in water, He said to me, He upon whom you see the Spirit descending and abiding upon Him, this is He who baptizes in the Holy Spirit.","And I have seen and have testified that this is the Son of God.","Again the next day John was standing with two of his disciples,","And looking at Jesus walking, he said, Behold, the Lamb of God!","And the two disciples heard him speak this, and they followed Jesus.","And Jesus, turning and beholding them following, said to them, What are you seeking? And they said to Him, Rabbi (which translated means Teacher), where are You staying?","He said to them, Come, and you will see. They went therefore and saw where He was staying, and they stayed with Him that day; it was about the tenth hour.","One of the two who heard this from John and followed Him was Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother.","He first found his own brother Simon and said to him, We have found the Messiah (which translated means Christ).","He led him to Jesus. Looking at him, Jesus said, You are Simon, the son of John; you shall be called Cephas (which is interpreted, Peter).","The next day He wanted to go forth into Galilee, and He found Philip. And Jesus said to him, Follow Me.","Now Philip was from Bethsaida, of the city of Andrew and Peter.","Philip found Nathanael and said to him, We have found Him of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, wrote, Jesus, the son of Joseph, from Nazareth.","And Nathanael said to him, Can anything good be from Nazareth? Philip said to him, Come and see.","Jesus saw Nathanael coming to Him and said concerning him, Behold, truly an Israelite, in whom there is no guile!","Nathanael said to Him, How do You know me? Jesus answered and said to him, Before Philip called you, while you were under the fig tree, I saw you.","Nathanael answered Him, Rabbi, You are the Son of God; You are the King of Israel.","Jesus answered and said to him, Is it because I told you that I saw you under the fig tree that you believe? You shall see greater things than these.","And He said to him, Truly, truly, I say to you, You shall see heaven opened and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man."],["And the third day a wedding took place in Cana of Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there.","And Jesus also was invited, as well as His disciples, to the wedding.","And when the wine ran out, the mother of Jesus said to Him, They have no wine.","And Jesus said to her, Woman, what do I have in this that concerns you? My hour has not yet come.","His mother said to the servants, Whatever He says to you, do.","Now there were six stone waterpots lying there, according to the Jews’ rite of purification, holding two or three measures each.","Jesus said to them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled them up to the brim.","And He said to them, Draw some out now and take it to the master of the feast. And they took it to him.","And when the master of the feast tasted the water which had become wine and did not know where it came from, though the servants who had drawn the water knew, the master of the feast called the bridegroom","And said to him, Every man sets out the good wine first, and when they have drunk freely, then that which is worse; you have kept the good wine until now.","This beginning of signs Jesus performed in Cana of Galilee and manifested His glory, and His disciples believed into Him.","After this He went down to Capernaum, He and His mother and His brothers and His disciples; and they remained there not many days.","And the Passover of the Jews was near, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.","And He found in the temple those selling oxen and sheep and doves, and the moneychangers sitting there.","And having made a whip out of cords, He drove them all out of the temple, as well as the sheep and the oxen, and He poured out the money of the moneychangers and overturned their tables.","And to those who were selling the doves He said, Take these things away from here; do not make My Father’s house a house of merchandise.","His disciples remembered that it was written, “The zeal of Your house shall devour Me.”","The Jews then answered and said to Him, What sign do You show us, seeing that You do these things?","Jesus answered and said to them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.","Then the Jews said, This temple was built in forty-six years, and You will raise it up in three days?","But He spoke of the temple of His body.","When therefore He was raised from the dead, His disciples remembered that He had said this, and they believed the Scripture and the word which Jesus had spoken.","Now when He was in Jerusalem at the Passover, during the feast, many believed into His name when they saw the signs which He did.","But Jesus Himself did not entrust Himself to them, for He knew all men,","And because He did not need anyone to testify concerning man, for He Himself knew what was in man."],["But there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews.","This one came to Him by night and said to Him, Rabbi, we know that You have come from God as a teacher, for no one can do these signs that You do unless God is with him.","Jesus answered and said to him, Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless one is born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of God.","Nicodemus said to Him, How can a man be born when he is old? He cannot enter a second time into his mother’s womb and be born, can he?","Jesus answered, Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.","That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.","Do not marvel that I said to you, You must be born anew.","The wind blows where it wills, and you hear the sound of it, but you do not know where it comes from and where it goes; so is everyone who is born of the Spirit.","Nicodemus answered and said to Him, How can these things be?","Jesus answered and said to him, You are a teacher of Israel, and you do not know these things?","Truly, truly, I say to you, We speak that which we know and testify of that which we have seen, and yet you do not receive our testimony.","If I told you of the things on earth and you do not believe, how will you believe if I tell you of the things in heaven?","And no one has ascended into heaven, but He who descended out of heaven, the Son of Man, who is in heaven.","And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up,","That everyone who believes into Him may have eternal life.","For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that everyone who believes into Him would not perish, but would have eternal life.","For God did not send the Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world might be saved through Him.","He who believes into Him is not condemned; but he who does not believe has been condemned already, because he has not believed into the name of the only begotten Son of God.","And this is the condemnation, that the light has come into the world, and men loved the darkness rather than the light, for their works were evil.","For everyone who practices evil hates the light, and does not come to the light, lest his works be reproved.","But he who does the truth comes to the light, that his works may be manifested that they are wrought in God.","After these things, Jesus and His disciples came into the land of Judea, and there He spent some time with them and baptized.","And John also was baptizing in Aenon near Salim, because there was much water there; and people came and were baptized;","For John had not yet been thrown into prison.","There arose therefore a questioning on the part of John’s disciples with a Jew about purification.","And they came to John and said to him, Rabbi, He who was with you across the Jordan, of whom you have testified, behold, He is baptizing and all are coming to Him.","John answered and said, A man cannot receive anything unless it has been given to him from heaven.","You yourselves testify of me that I said, I am not the Christ, but I have been sent before Him.","He who has the bride is the bridegroom; but the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices with joy because of the bridegroom’s voice. This joy of mine therefore is made full.","He must increase, but I must decrease.","He who comes from above is above all; he who is from the earth is of the earth and speaks out of the earth. He who comes from heaven is above all.","What He has seen and heard, of this He testifies, and no one receives His testimony.","He who receives His testimony has sealed that God is true.","For He whom God has sent speaks the words of God, for He gives the Spirit not by measure.","The Father loves the Son and has given all into His hand.","He who believes into the Son has eternal life; but he who disobeys the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abides upon him."],["When therefore the Lord knew that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus was making and baptizing more disciples than John","(Although Jesus Himself did not baptize, but rather His disciples),","He left Judea and went away again into Galilee.","And He had to pass through Samaria.","So He came to a city of Samaria called Sychar, near the piece of land that Jacob gave to Joseph his son;","And Jacob’s well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied from the journey, sat thus by the well; it was about the sixth hour.","There came a woman of Samaria to draw water. Jesus said to her, Give Me something to drink.","For His disciples had gone away into the city to buy food.","The Samaritan woman then said to Him, How is it that You, being a Jew, ask for a drink from me, who am a Samaritan woman? (For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.)","Jesus answered and said to her, If you knew the gift of God and who it is who says to you, Give Me a drink, you would have asked Him, and He would have given you living water.","The woman said to Him, Sir, You have no bucket, and the well is deep; where then do You get this living water?","Are You greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well and drank of it himself, as well as his sons and his cattle?","Jesus answered and said to her, Everyone who drinks of this water shall thirst again,","But whoever drinks of the water that I will give him shall by no means thirst forever; but the water that I will give him will become in him a fountain of water springing up into eternal life.","The woman said to Him, Sir, give me this water so that I will not thirst nor come here to draw.","He said to her, Go, call your husband and come here.","The woman answered and said, I do not have a husband. Jesus said to her, You have well said, I do not have a husband,","For you have had five husbands, and the one you now have is not your husband; this you have said truly.","The woman said to Him, Sir, I perceive that You are a prophet.","Our fathers worshipped in this mountain, yet you say that in Jerusalem is the place where men must worship.","Jesus said to her, Woman, believe Me, an hour is coming when neither in this mountain nor in Jerusalem will you worship the Father.","You worship that which you do not know; we worship that which we know, for salvation is of the Jews.","But an hour is coming, and it is now, when the true worshippers will worship the Father in spirit and truthfulness, for the Father also seeks such to worship Him.","God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truthfulness.","The woman said to Him, I know that Messiah is coming (He who is called Christ); when He comes, He will declare all things to us.","Jesus said to her, I, who speak to you, am He.","And at this point His disciples came, and they marveled that He was speaking with a woman; yet no one said, What are You seeking? or, Why are You speaking with her?","Then the woman left her waterpot and went away into the city, and said to the people,","Come, see a man who told me all that I have done. Is this not the Christ?","They went out of the city and came to Him.","In the meantime, the disciples urged Him, saying, Rabbi, eat.","But He said to them, I have food to eat that you do not know about.","The disciples therefore said to one another, Has anyone brought Him anything to eat?","Jesus said to them, My food is to do the will of Him who sent Me and to finish His work.","Do you not say that there are yet four months and then the harvest comes? Behold, I tell you, Lift up your eyes and look on the fields, for they are already white for harvest.","He who reaps receives wages and gathers fruit unto eternal life, in order that he who sows and he who reaps may rejoice together.","For in this the saying is true, One sows and another reaps.","I sent you to reap that for which you have not labored; others have labored, and you have entered into their labor.","And many of the Samaritans from that city believed into Him because of the word of the woman who testified, He told me all that I have done.","So when the Samaritans came to Him, they asked Him to remain with them, and He remained there two days.","And many more believed because of His word.","And they said to the woman, It is no longer because of your speaking that we believe, for we ourselves have heard and know that this One is truly the Savior of the world.","And after the two days He went forth from there into Galilee,","For Jesus Himself testified that a prophet has no honor in his own country.","Then when He came into Galilee, the Galileans received Him, having seen all that He did in Jerusalem at the feast, for they also went to the feast.","He then came again to Cana of Galilee, where He had made the water wine. And there was a certain royal official, whose son was sick in Capernaum.","When he heard that Jesus had come out of Judea into Galilee, he went to Him and asked Him to come down and heal his son, for he was about to die.","Jesus therefore said to him, Unless you see signs and wonders, you will by no means believe.","The royal official said to Him, Sir, come down before my little child dies.","Jesus said to him, Go, your son lives. The man believed the word which Jesus said to him and went his way.","And as he was now going down, his slaves met him and said that his child was living.","So he asked them the hour in which he got better. They said then to him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.","Then the father knew that it was in that hour in which Jesus said to him, Your son lives; and he believed, he and his whole house.","Again, this second sign Jesus performed when He came out of Judea into Galilee."],["After these things there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.","Now there is in Jerusalem near the Sheep Gate a pool, which is called in Hebrew Bethesda, having five porticoes.","In these lay a multitude of those who were sick, blind, lame, and withered, waiting for the moving of the water.","For an angel went down from time to time in the pool and stirred up the water; the first then to step in after the stirring up of the water was made well of whatever disease he was being held by.","And a certain man was there, who had been thirty-eight years in his sickness.","When Jesus saw this one lying there and knew that he had already been a long time in that condition, He said to him, Do you want to get well?","The sick man answered Him, Sir, I have no one to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up; but while I am coming, another steps down before me.","Jesus said to him, Rise, take up your mat and walk.","And immediately the man became well, and he took up his mat and walked. Now it was the Sabbath on that day;","Therefore the Jews said to the one who had been healed, It is the Sabbath, and it is not lawful for you to take up your mat.","But he answered them, He who made me well, that One said to me, Take up your mat and walk.","They asked him, Who is the man who said to you, Take up your mat and walk?","But he who had been healed did not know who it was, for Jesus had withdrawn, there being a crowd in that place.","After these things Jesus found him in the temple and said to him, Behold, you have become well; sin no more so that nothing worse happens to you.","The man went away and told the Jews that Jesus was the One who made him well.","And because of this the Jews persecuted Jesus and sought to kill Him, because He did these things on the Sabbath.","But Jesus answered them, My Father is working until now, and I also am working.","Because of this therefore the Jews sought all the more to kill Him, because He not only broke the Sabbath but also called God His own Father, making Himself equal with God.","Then Jesus answered and said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, The Son can do nothing from Himself except what He sees the Father doing, for whatever that One does, these things the Son also does in like manner.","For the Father loves the Son and shows Him all things that He Himself is doing; and greater works than these He will show Him that you may marvel.","For just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, so also the Son gives life to whom He wills.","For neither does the Father judge anyone, but He has given all judgment to the Son,","In order that all may honor the Son even as they honor the Father. He who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent Him.","Truly, truly, I say to you, He who hears My word and believes Him who sent Me has eternal life, and does not come into judgment but has passed out of death into life.","Truly, truly, I say to you, An hour is coming, and it is now, when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear will live.","For just as the Father has life in Himself, so He gave to the Son to also have life in Himself;","And He gave Him authority to execute judgment because He is the Son of Man.","Do not marvel at this, for an hour is coming in which all in the tombs will hear His voice","And will come forth: those who have done good, to the resurrection of life; and those who have practiced evil, to the resurrection of judgment.","I can do nothing from Myself; as I hear, I judge, and My judgment is just, because I do not seek My own will but the will of Him who sent Me.","If I testify concerning Myself, My testimony is not true.","There is another who testifies concerning Me, and I know that the testimony which he testifies concerning Me is true.","You have sent people to John, and he has testified to the truth.","But it is not from man that I receive My testimony, but I say these things that you may be saved.","He was the lamp that was burning and shining, and you were willing to exult for a while in his light.","But I have the testimony which is greater than that of John, for the works which the Father has given Me to finish, the works themselves which I do, testify concerning Me that the Father has sent Me.","And the Father who sent Me, He has testified concerning Me. You have neither heard His voice at any time, nor have you seen His form,","And you do not have His word abiding in you, for Him whom He sent, this One you do not believe.","You search the Scriptures, because you think that in them you have eternal life; and it is these that testify concerning Me.","Yet you are not willing to come to Me that you may have life.","I do not receive glory from men.","But I know you, that you do not have the love of God in yourselves.","I have come in the name of My Father, and you do not receive Me; if another comes in his own name, you will receive him.","How can you believe when you receive glory from one another and do not seek the glory that is from the only God?","Do not think that I will accuse you before the Father; there is one who accuses you: Moses, in whom you have set your hope.","For if you believed Moses, you would believe Me; for he wrote concerning Me.","But if you do not believe his writings, how will you believe My words?"],["After these things Jesus went away across the Sea of Galilee, which is the Sea of Tiberias.","And a great crowd followed Him, because they saw the signs which He did on those who were sick.","And Jesus went up to the mountain and sat there with His disciples.","Now the Passover, the feast of the Jews, was near.","Jesus then lifting up His eyes and seeing that a great crowd was coming toward Him, said to Philip, Where shall we buy bread that these may eat?","But this He said to test him, for He Himself knew what He was about to do.","Philip answered Him, Two hundred denarii worth of bread is not sufficient for them, that each one may take a little.","One of His disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, said to Him,","There is a little boy here who has five barley loaves and two fish; but what are these for so many?","Jesus said, Have the people recline. Now there was much grass in the place. So the men reclined, in number about five thousand.","Jesus then took the loaves, and when He had given thanks, He distributed to those who were reclining; likewise also of the fish, as much as they wanted.","And when they were filled, He said to His disciples, Gather the broken pieces left over that nothing may be lost.","So they gathered them and filled twelve handbaskets with broken pieces from the five barley loaves which were left over among those who had eaten.","The people therefore, seeing the sign which He did, said, This is truly the Prophet who is to come into the world.","Then Jesus, knowing that they were about to come and take Him by force to make Him King, withdrew again to the mountain, Himself alone.","And when evening fell, His disciples went down to the sea,","And they got into a boat and began crossing the sea to Capernaum. And it had already become dark, and Jesus had not yet come to them.","And because a strong wind was blowing, the sea was churning.","Then, when they had rowed about twenty-five or thirty stadia, they saw Jesus walking on the sea and coming near the boat, and they became frightened.","But He said to them, It is I. Do not be afraid.","Then they were willing to take Him into the boat; and immediately the boat was at the land to which they were going.","The next day the crowd which stood on the other side of the sea saw that there had been no other small boat there except one, and that Jesus had not gotten into the boat with His disciples, but that His disciples had gone away alone.","But other small boats from Tiberias came near to the place where they ate the bread after the Lord had given thanks.","So when the crowd saw that Jesus was not there, nor His disciples, they themselves got into the small boats and came to Capernaum, seeking Jesus.","And when they found Him on the other side of the sea, they said to Him, Rabbi, when did You get here?","Jesus answered them and said, Truly, truly, I say to you, You seek Me not because you have seen signs, but because you ate of the bread and were filled.","Work not for the food which perishes, but for the food which abides unto eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you; for Him has the Father, even God, sealed.","Then they said to Him, What shall we do that we may work the works of God?","Jesus answered and said to them, This is the work of God, that you believe into Him whom He has sent.","They said then to Him, What sign then will You do that we may see and believe You? What work will You do?","Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, as it is written, “He gave them bread out of heaven to eat.”","Jesus therefore said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, Moses has not given you the bread out of heaven, but My Father gives you the true bread out of heaven.","For the bread of God is He who comes down out of heaven and gives life to the world.","They said therefore to Him, Lord, give us this bread always.","Jesus said to them, I am the bread of life; he who comes to Me shall by no means hunger, and he who believes into Me shall by no means ever thirst.","But I have said to you that you have also seen Me, and yet you do not believe.","All that the Father gives Me will come to Me, and him who comes to Me I shall by no means cast out.","For I have come down from heaven not to do My own will but the will of Him who sent Me.","And this is the will of Him who sent Me, that of all which He has given Me I should lose nothing but should raise it up in the last day.","For this is the will of My Father, that everyone who beholds the Son and believes into Him should have eternal life, and I will raise him up in the last day.","The Jews therefore murmured concerning Him because He said, I am the bread that came down out of heaven.","And they said, Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How does He now say, I have come down out of heaven?","Jesus answered and said to them, Do not murmur among yourselves.","No one can come to Me unless the Father who sent Me draws him; and I will raise him up in the last day.","It is written in the prophets, “And they shall all be taught of God.” Everyone who has heard and learned from the Father comes to Me.","Not that anyone has seen the Father, except Him who is from God, He has seen the Father.","Truly, truly, I say to you, He who believes has eternal life.","I am the bread of life.","Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and they died.","This is the bread which comes down out of heaven, that anyone may eat of it and not die.","I am the living bread which came down out of heaven; if anyone eats of this bread, he shall live forever; and the bread which I will give is My flesh, given for the life of the world.","The Jews then contended with one another, saying, How can this man give us His flesh to eat?","Jesus therefore said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink His blood, you do not have life within yourselves.","He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up in the last day.","For My flesh is true food, and My blood is true drink.","He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood abides in Me and I in him.","As the living Father has sent Me and I live because of the Father, so he who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me.","This is the bread which came down out of heaven, not as the fathers ate and died; he who eats this bread shall live forever.","He said these things in a synagogue as He taught in Capernaum.","Many therefore of His disciples, when they heard this, said, This word is hard; who can hear it?","But Jesus, knowing in Himself that His disciples were murmuring about this, said to them, Does this stumble you?","Then what if you saw the Son of Man ascending to where He was before?","It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh profits nothing; the words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life.","But there are some of you who do not believe. For Jesus knew from the beginning who were the ones who did not believe and who was the one who would betray Him.","And He said, For this reason I have told you that no one can come to Me unless it has been given to him from the Father.","From that time many of His disciples went back to what they left behind and no longer walked with Him.","Jesus therefore said to the twelve, Do you also want to go away?","Simon Peter answered Him, Lord, to whom shall we go? You have words of eternal life,","And we have believed and have come to know that You are the Holy One of God.","Jesus answered them, Was it not I who chose you, the twelve? Yet one of you is a devil.","Now He spoke of Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot, for he, one of the twelve, would betray Him."],["And after these things Jesus walked in Galilee, for He would not walk in Judea, because the Jews were seeking to kill Him.","Now the Jews’ Feast of Tabernacles was near.","His brothers therefore said to Him, Depart from here and go into Judea, so that Your disciples also may behold Your works which You are doing;","For no one does anything in secret and himself seeks to be known openly. If You do these things, manifest Yourself to the world.","For not even His brothers believed into Him.","Jesus therefore said to them, My time has not yet come, but your time is always ready.","The world cannot hate you, but it hates Me, because I testify concerning it, that its works are evil.","You go up to the feast; I am not going up to this feast, because My time has not yet been fulfilled.","And having said these things to them, He remained in Galilee.","But when His brothers had gone up to the feast, then He Himself also went up, not openly, but as it were in secret.","The Jews therefore sought Him at the feast and said, Where is He?","And there was much murmuring about Him among the crowds: some said, He is a good man; but others said, No; rather He leads the crowd astray.","Yet no one spoke openly about Him for fear of the Jews.","But when it was now the middle of the feast, Jesus went up into the temple and began to teach.","The Jews therefore marveled and said, How does this man know letters, without ever having studied?","Jesus therefore answered them and said, My teaching is not Mine, but His who sent Me.","If anyone resolves to do His will, he will know concerning the teaching, whether it is of God or whether I speak from Myself.","He who speaks from himself seeks his own glory; but He who seeks the glory of Him who sent Him, this One is true, and unrighteousness is not in Him.","Has not Moses given you the law? Yet none of you keeps the law. Why do you seek to kill Me?","The crowd answered, You have a demon! Who is seeking to kill You?","Jesus answered and said to them, I did one work, and you all marvel.","For the same reason Moses gave you circumcision (not that it is from Moses, but from the fathers), and on the Sabbath you circumcise a man.","If a man receives circumcision on the Sabbath that the law of Moses may not be broken, are you angry with Me because I made an entire man well on the Sabbath?","Do not judge according to appearance, but judge the righteous judgment.","Then some of the people of Jerusalem said, Is not this the One whom they are seeking to kill?","And look, He is speaking openly, and they say nothing to Him. Have the rulers, perhaps, really recognized that this is the Christ?","But we know where this man is from; yet when the Christ comes, no one knows where He is from.","Jesus therefore cried out in the temple, teaching and saying, You both know Me and know where I am from; and I have not come of Myself, but He who sent Me is true, whom you do not know.","I know Him, because I am from Him, and He sent Me.","They sought then to seize Him, yet no one laid a hand on Him, because His hour had not yet come.","But many out of the crowd believed into Him and said, Will the Christ, when He comes, do more signs than this man has done?","The Pharisees heard the crowd murmuring these things about Him, and the chief priests and the Pharisees sent attendants to arrest Him.","Jesus therefore said, I am still with you a little while, and then I am going to Him who sent Me.","You will seek Me and will not find Me; and where I am, you cannot come.","The Jews then said to one another, Where is this man about to go that we will not find Him? Is He about to go to the Jews in dispersion among the Greeks and teach the Greeks?","What is the word which He said, You will seek Me and will not find Me; and where I am, you cannot come?","Now on the last day, the great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, saying, If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink.","He who believes into Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water.","But this He said concerning the Spirit, whom those who believed into Him were about to receive; for the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified.","Some of the crowd therefore, when they heard these words, said, This is truly the Prophet.","Others said, This is the Christ. But some said, Does then the Christ come out of Galilee?","Has not the Scripture said that the Christ comes out of the seed of David and from Bethlehem, the village where David was?","So there arose a division among the crowd because of Him.","And some of them wanted to seize Him, but no one laid hands on Him.","The attendants therefore came to the chief priests and Pharisees, and these said to them, Why did you not bring Him?","The attendants answered, Never has a man spoken as this man has.","The Pharisees then answered them, Have you also been deceived?","Has any one of the rulers or Pharisees believed into Him?","But this crowd which does not know the law is accursed.","Nicodemus said to them (he who came to Him before, being one of them),","Does our law condemn a man unless it first hears from him and knows what he is doing?","They answered and said to him, Are you also from Galilee? Search and see that no prophet arises out of Galilee.","And everyone went to his own house."],["But Jesus went to the Mount of Olives.","And early in the morning He came again into the temple, and all the people came to Him, and He sat down and taught them.","And the scribes and Pharisees brought a woman caught in adultery, and having set her in the midst,","They said to Him, Teacher, this woman has been caught committing adultery, in the very act.","Now in the law, Moses commanded us to stone such women. What then do You say?","But they said this to tempt Him, so that they might have reason to accuse Him. But Jesus stooped down and wrote with His finger on the ground.","But when they persisted in questioning Him, He stood up and said to them, He who is without sin among you, let him be the first to throw a stone at her.","And again He stooped down and wrote on the ground.","And when they heard that, they went out one by one, beginning with the older ones. And Jesus was left alone, and the woman stood where she was, in the midst.","And Jesus stood up and said to her, Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?","And she said, No one, Lord. And Jesus said, Neither do I condemn you; go, and from now on sin no more.","Again therefore Jesus spoke to them, saying, I am the light of the world; he who follows Me shall by no means walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.","The Pharisees then said to Him, You are testifying concerning Yourself; Your testimony is not true.","Jesus answered and said to them, Even if I testify concerning Myself, My testimony is true, for I know where I came from and where I am going; but you do not know where I come from or where I am going.","You judge according to the flesh; I judge no one.","But even if I do judge, My judgment is true, for I am not alone, but I and the Father who sent Me.","And in your law also it has been written that the testimony of two men is true:","I am One who testifies concerning Myself, and the Father who sent Me testifies concerning Me.","They said then to Him, Where is Your Father? Jesus answered, You know neither Me nor My Father; if you knew Me, you would know My Father also.","These words He spoke in the treasury as He taught in the temple; and no one seized Him, because His hour had not yet come.","He said therefore again to them, I am going away, and you will seek Me and will die in your sin. Where I am going, you cannot come.","The Jews then said, He is not going to kill Himself, is He, for He says, Where I am going, you cannot come?","And He said to them, You are from below, I am from above; you are of this world, I am not of this world.","Therefore I said to you that you will die in your sins; for unless you believe that I am, you will die in your sins.","They said then to Him, Who are You? Jesus said to them, Altogether that which I also tell you.","I have many things to say and to judge concerning you, but He who sent Me is true, and what I have heard from Him, these things I speak to the world.","They did not understand that He was speaking to them of the Father.","Jesus therefore said to them, When you lift up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am, and that I do nothing from Myself, but as My Father has taught Me, I speak these things.","And He who sent Me is with Me; He has not left Me alone, for I always do the things that are pleasing to Him.","As He spoke these things, many believed into Him.","Then Jesus said to those Jews who believed Him, If you abide in My word, you are truly My disciples;","And you shall know the truth, and the truth shall set you free.","They answered Him, We are Abraham’s seed and have never yet been enslaved to anyone. How is it that You say, You shall become free?","Jesus answered them, Truly, truly, I say to you, Everyone who commits sin is a slave of sin.","And the slave does not abide in the house forever; the son does abide forever.","If therefore the Son sets you free, you shall be free indeed.","I know that you are Abraham’s seed; but you seek to kill Me because My word has no place in you.","I speak the things which I have seen with My Father; so then, you also do the things which you have heard from your father.","They answered and said to Him, Our father is Abraham. Jesus said to them, If you were Abraham’s children, you would do the works of Abraham.","But now you are seeking to kill Me, a man who has told you the truth which I heard from God; Abraham did not do this.","You do the works of your father. They then said to Him, We were not born of fornication; we have one Father, God.","Jesus said to them, If God were your Father, you would love Me; for I came forth out from God and have come from Him; for I have not come of Myself, but He sent Me.","Why do you not understand My speaking? It is because you cannot hear My word.","You are of your father the devil, and you want to do the desires of your father. He was a murderer from the beginning and does not stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaks the lie, he speaks it out of his own possessions; for he is a liar and the father of it.","But because I speak the truth, you do not believe Me.","Which of you convicts Me of sin? Since I speak truth, why do you not believe Me?","He who is of God hears the words of God; for this reason you do not hear them, because you are not of God.","The Jews answered and said to Him, Have we not spoken well in saying that You are a Samaritan and have a demon?","Jesus answered, I do not have a demon, but I honor My Father, and you dishonor Me.","But I do not seek My glory; there is One who seeks glory for Me and judges.","Truly, truly, I say to you, If anyone keeps My word, he shall by no means see death forever.","The Jews therefore said to Him, Now we know that You have a demon. Abraham died, and the prophets too; yet You say, If anyone keeps My word, he shall by no means taste death forever.","Are You greater than our father Abraham, who died? The prophets died too. Who are You making Yourself?","Jesus answered, If I glorify Myself, My glory is nothing; it is My Father who glorifies Me, of whom you say that He is your God.","Yet you have not known Him, but I know Him. And if I say that I do not know Him, I will be like you, a liar; but I do know Him and I keep His word.","Your father Abraham exulted that he would see My day, and he saw it and rejoiced.","The Jews then said to Him, You are not yet fifty years old, and have You seen Abraham?","Jesus said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, Before Abraham came into being, I am.","So they picked up stones to throw at Him, but Jesus was hidden and went out of the temple."],["And as He passed by, He saw a man blind from birth.","And His disciples asked Him, saying, Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he would be born blind?","Jesus answered, Neither has this man sinned nor his parents, but he was born so, that the works of God might be manifested in him.","We must work the works of Him who sent Me while it is day; night is coming when no one can work.","While I am in the world, I am the light of the world.","When He had said this, He spat on the ground and made clay of the spittle and anointed his eyes with the clay,","And He said to him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam (which is interpreted, Sent). He went therefore and washed and came away seeing.","The neighbors then and those who previously saw him as a beggar said, Is not this the one who used to sit and beg?","Some said, This is he. Others said, No, but he is like him. He said, I am the one.","They said then to him, How then were your eyes opened?","He answered, The man called Jesus made clay and anointed my eyes, and said to me, Go to the pool of Siloam and wash. I went therefore and washed, and I received my sight.","And they said to him, Where is He? He said, I do not know.","They brought him who was once blind to the Pharisees.","Now it was the Sabbath, on which day Jesus made the clay and opened his eyes.","Again therefore the Pharisees also asked him how he received his sight. And he said to them, He put clay on my eyes, and I washed, and I see.","Then some of the Pharisees said, This man is not from God, because He does not keep the Sabbath. But others said, How can a man who is a sinner do such signs? And there was a division among them.","Then they said to the blind man again, What do you say about Him, in that He opened your eyes? And he said, He is a prophet.","The Jews then did not believe concerning him that he had been blind and had received his sight, until they called the parents of him who had received his sight","And asked them, saying, Is this your son, of whom you say that he was born blind? How then does he now see?","Then his parents answered them and said, We know that this is our son and that he was born blind.","But how he now sees, we do not know; or who opened his eyes, we do not know. Ask him; he is of age; he will speak for himself.","His parents said these things because they feared the Jews, for the Jews had already agreed that if anyone confessed Him to be the Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue.","Because of this his parents said, He is of age; question him.","Therefore a second time they called the man who had been blind, and said to him, Give glory to God; we know that this man is a sinner.","Then he answered, Whether or not He is a sinner, I do not know; one thing I do know, that though I was blind, now I see.","They said then to him, What did He do to you? How did He open your eyes?","He answered them, I told you already and you did not hear. Why do you want to hear it again? Do you also want to become His disciples?","And they reviled him and said, You are His disciple; but we are disciples of Moses.","We know that God has spoken to Moses, but as for this man, we do not know where He is from.","The man answered and said to them, Why here is an amazing thing, that you do not know where He is from, and yet He opened my eyes!","We know that God does not hear sinners, but if anyone is God-fearing and does His will, He hears him.","Since time began it has never been heard that anyone opened the eyes of one born blind.","If this man were not from God, He could do nothing.","They answered and said to him, You were wholly born in sins, and you are teaching us? And they cast him out.","Jesus heard that they had cast him out, and He found him and said, Do you believe into the Son of God?","He answered and said, And who is He, Lord, that I may believe into Him?","Jesus said to him, You have both seen Him, and He is the One speaking with you.","And he said, Lord, I believe; and he worshipped Him.","And Jesus said, For judgment I have come into this world, that those who do not see may see, and that those who see may become blind.","Some of the Pharisees who were with Him heard these things and said to Him, We are not blind also, are we?","Jesus said to them, If you were blind, you would not have sin; but now that you say, We see; your sin remains."],["Truly, truly, I say to you, He who does not enter through the door into the sheepfold, but climbs up from somewhere else, he is a thief and a robber;","But he who enters through the door is the shepherd of the sheep.","To him the doorkeeper opens, and the sheep hear his voice; and he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out.","When he puts forth all his own, he goes before them, and the sheep follow him because they know his voice.","But they will by no means follow a stranger, but will flee from him, because they do not know the voice of strangers.","This parable Jesus spoke to them, but they did not know what those things meant that He spoke to them.","Jesus therefore said to them again, Truly, truly, I say to you that I am the door of the sheep.","All who came before Me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not hear them.","I am the door; if anyone enters through Me, he shall be saved and shall go in and go out and shall find pasture.","The thief does not come except to steal and kill and destroy; I have come that they may have life and may have it abundantly.","I am the good Shepherd; the good Shepherd lays down His life for the sheep.","He who is a hireling and not the shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, sees the wolf coming and leaves the sheep and flees; and the wolf snatches them and scatters them.","He flees because he is a hireling and it does not matter to him concerning the sheep.","I am the good Shepherd, and I know My own, and My own know Me,","Even as the Father knows Me and I know the Father; and I lay down My life for the sheep.","And I have other sheep, which are not of this fold; I must lead them also, and they shall hear My voice, and there shall be one flock, one Shepherd.","For this reason the Father loves Me, because I lay down My life that I may take it again.","No one takes it away from Me, but I lay it down of Myself. I have authority to lay it down, and I have authority to take it again. This commandment I received from My Father.","A division again took place among the Jews because of these words.","And many of them said, He has a demon and is insane. Why do you listen to Him?","Others said, These are not the words of one who is demon-possessed. Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?","At that time the Feast of the Dedication occurred in Jerusalem, and it was winter.","And Jesus was walking in the temple in the portico of Solomon.","The Jews therefore surrounded Him and said to Him, How long will You hold our soul in suspense? If You are the Christ, tell us plainly.","Jesus answered them, I told you, and you do not believe. The works which I do in My Father’s name, these testify concerning Me;","But you do not believe, because you are not of My sheep.","My sheep hear My voice, and I know them, and they follow Me;","And I give to them eternal life, and they shall by no means perish forever, and no one shall snatch them out of My hand.","My Father, who has given them to Me, is greater than all, and no one can snatch them out of My Father’s hand.","I and the Father are one.","The Jews again took up stones that they might stone Him.","Jesus answered them, I have shown you many good works from the Father; for which of these works are you stoning Me?","The Jews answered Him, We are not stoning You for a good work, but for blasphemy, and because You, being a man, are making Yourself God.","Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, “I said, You are gods”?","If He said they were gods, to whom the word of God came, and the Scripture cannot be broken,","Do you say of Him whom the Father has sanctified and sent into the world, You are blaspheming, because I said, I am the Son of God?","If I do not do the works of My Father, do not believe Me;","But if I do them, even if you do not believe Me, believe the works so that you may come to know and continue to know that the Father is in Me and I am in the Father.","Then they sought again to seize Him, yet He went forth out of their hand.","And He went away again across the Jordan, to the place where John was baptizing at first, and He remained there.","And many came to Him and said, John did no sign, but all the things John said concerning this man were true.","And many believed into Him there."],["Now there was a certain man who was sick, Lazarus from Bethany, of the village of Mary and her sister Martha.","It was that Mary who anointed the Lord with ointment and wiped His feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.","The sisters therefore sent to Him saying, Lord, behold, he whom You love is sick.","But when Jesus heard it, He said, This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, in order that the Son of God may be glorified through it.","Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus.","When therefore He heard that he was sick, He remained at that time in the place where He was for two days.","Then after this He said to the disciples, Let us go into Judea again.","The disciples said to Him, Rabbi, the Jews were just now seeking to stone You, and You are going there again?","Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If anyone walks in the day, he does not stumble, because he sees the light of this world.","But if anyone walks in the night, he stumbles, because the light is not in him.","He said these things, and after this He said to them, Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep; but I am going that I may wake him out of sleep.","The disciples then said to Him, Lord, if he has fallen asleep, he will recover.","But Jesus had spoken about his death, but they thought that He was speaking about taking rest in sleep.","So Jesus then told them plainly, Lazarus has died.","And I rejoice for your sakes that I was not there, so that you may believe; but let us go to him.","Then Thomas, who is called Didymus, said to his fellow disciples, Let us also go, that we may die with Him.","Then when Jesus came, He found that he had already been in the tomb four days.","Now Bethany was near Jerusalem, about fifteen stadia away.","And many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary to console them concerning their brother.","Martha therefore, when she heard that Jesus was coming, went to meet Him; but Mary sat in the house.","Then Martha said to Jesus, Lord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died.","But even now I know that whatever You ask of God, God will give You.","Jesus said to her, Your brother will rise again.","Martha said to Him, I know that he will rise again in the resurrection in the last day.","Jesus said to her, I am the resurrection and the life; he who believes into Me, even if he should die, shall live;","And everyone who lives and believes into Me shall by no means die forever. Do you believe this?","She said to Him, Yes, Lord; I have believed that You are the Christ, the Son of God, He who comes into the world.","And when she had said this, she went away and called Mary her sister secretly, saying, The Teacher is here and is calling you.","And she, when she heard this, rose quickly and came to Him.","Now Jesus had not yet come into the village, but was still in the place where Martha met Him.","The Jews then who were with her in the house and were consoling her, when they saw that Mary rose up quickly and went out, followed her, supposing that she was going to the tomb to weep there.","Then Mary, when she came to where Jesus was, saw Him and fell at His feet, saying to Him, Lord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died.","Then Jesus, when He saw her weeping and the Jews who came with her weeping, was moved with indignation in His spirit and was troubled,","And He said, Where have you put him? They said to Him, Lord, come and see.","Jesus wept.","The Jews then said, Behold how He loved him!","But some of them said, Could not He who opened the eyes of the blind man also have caused that this man would not die?","Jesus therefore, moved with indignation again in Himself, came to the tomb. Now it was a cave, and a stone was lying against it.","Jesus said, Take away the stone. Martha, the sister of him who was deceased, said to Him, Lord, by now he smells, for it is the fourth day that he is there.","Jesus said to her, Did I not tell you that if you believe you will see the glory of God?","Then they took the stone away. And Jesus lifted up His eyes and said, Father, I thank You that You have heard Me.","And I knew that You always hear Me; but because of the crowd standing around, I said it, that they may believe that You have sent Me.","And when He had said these things, He cried out with a loud voice, Lazarus, come out!","And he who had died came out, bound hand and foot with cloths, and his face was bound about with a handkerchief. Jesus said to them, Loose him and let him go.","Many of the Jews therefore who had come to Mary and beheld the things that He did believed into Him.","But some of them went away to the Pharisees and told them the things that Jesus did.","Then the chief priests and the Pharisees assembled a council and said, What do we do? For this man is doing many signs.","If we let Him do so, all will believe into Him, and the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation.","But a certain one of them, Caiaphas, who was high priest that year, said to them, You know nothing at all,","Nor do you take account of the fact that it is expedient for you that one man die for the people and that not the whole nation perish.","But this he did not say from himself, but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus was to die for the nation,","And not for the nation only, but that He might also gather into one the children of God who are scattered abroad.","From that day therefore they took counsel to kill Him.","Jesus therefore no longer walked openly among the Jews, but went away from there to the region near the wilderness, into a city called Ephraim, and there He remained with the disciples.","Now the Passover of the Jews was near, and many went up to Jerusalem out of the country before the Passover in order to purify themselves.","They then sought Jesus, and said to one another as they stood in the temple, What do you think? That He will not, by any means, come to the feast?","Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had given orders that if anyone knew where He was, he should disclose it, so that they might arrest Him."],["Then Jesus, six days before the Passover, came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, whom Jesus had raised from the dead.","Therefore they made Him a supper there; and Martha served, but Lazarus was one of the ones reclining at table with Him.","Then Mary took a pound of ointment, of very valuable pure nard, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped His feet with her hair; and the house was filled with the fragrance of the ointment.","But Judas Iscariot, one of His disciples, who was about to betray Him, said,","Why was this ointment not sold for three hundred denarii and given to the poor?","But he said this not because it mattered to him concerning the poor, but because he was a thief, and holding the purse, carried off what was put into it.","Then Jesus said, Leave her alone; she has reserved it for the day of My burial.","For the poor you always have with you, but you do not always have Me.","Then a great crowd of the Jews found out that He was there, and they came, not because of Jesus only, but that they might also see Lazarus, whom He had raised from the dead.","And the chief priests took counsel to kill Lazarus also,","Because on account of him many of the Jews went away and believed into Jesus.","On the next day, the great crowd who had come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming into Jerusalem,","Took the branches of the palm trees and went out to meet Him, and cried out, Hosanna! Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord, even the King of Israel!","And Jesus, having found a young donkey, sat on it, as it is written,","“Fear not, daughter of Zion; behold, your King comes, sitting on a donkey’s colt.”","These things His disciples did not understand at first, but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things were written of Him and that they had done these things to Him.","The crowd therefore that was with Him when He called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead testified.","For this reason the crowd also went and met Him, because they heard that He had done this sign.","The Pharisees then said to one another, You see that you are not doing anything worthwhile; behold, the world has gone after Him.","And there were some Greeks among those who went up to worship at the feast.","These then came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida of Galilee, and asked him, saying, Sir, we wish to see Jesus.","Philip came and told Andrew; Andrew came, and Philip too, and they told Jesus.","And Jesus answered them, saying, The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified.","Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit.","He who loves his soul-life loses it; and he who hates his soul-life in this world shall keep it unto eternal life.","If anyone serves Me, let him follow Me; and where I am, there also My servant will be.

Therefore they took Jesus.","And bearing the cross for Himself, He went out to the place called the Place of a Skull, which is called in Hebrew, Golgotha,","Where they crucified Him, and with Him two others, on this side and that, and Jesus in the middle.","And Pilate wrote a notice also and put it on the cross; and it was written, JESUS THE NAZARENE, THE KING OF THE JEWS.","This notice therefore many of the Jews read, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city, and it was written in Hebrew, in Latin, and in Greek.","The chief priests of the Jews therefore said to Pilate, Do not write, The King of the Jews, but that He said, I am the King of the Jews.","Pilate answered, What I have written, I have written.","The soldiers then, when they had crucified Jesus, took His garments and made four parts, a part for each soldier, and they took the tunic as well. But the tunic was seamless, woven from the top throughout.","They said therefore to one another, Let us not tear it, but let us cast lots for it to see whose it shall be, that the Scripture might be fulfilled which says, “They divided My garments among themselves, and for My clothing they cast lots.” So then the soldiers did these things.","And there were standing by the cross of Jesus His mother and His mother’s sister and Mary the wife of Clopas and Mary the Magdalene.","Then Jesus, seeing His mother and the disciple whom He loved standing by, said to His mother, Woman, behold, your son.","Then He said to the disciple, Behold, your mother. And from that hour the disciple took her into his own home.","After this, Jesus, knowing that all things had now been finished and so that the Scripture might be fulfilled, said, I thirst.","There was lying there a vessel full of vinegar; therefore, they put a sponge full of vinegar on hyssop and brought it to His mouth.","Then when Jesus had taken the vinegar, He said, It is finished! And He bowed His head and delivered up His spirit.","Then the Jews, since it was the day of preparation and so that the bodies might not remain on the cross on the Sabbath (for that Sabbath day was a great Sabbath), requested of Pilate that their legs might be broken and that they might be taken away.","The soldiers therefore came and broke the legs of the first man and of the other man who had been crucified with Him.","But coming to Jesus, when they saw that He had already died, they did not break His legs;","But one of the soldiers pierced His side with a spear, and immediately there came out blood and water.","And he who has seen this has testified, and his testimony is true; and he knows that he says what is true, that you also may believe.","For these things happened that the Scripture might be fulfilled: “No bone of His shall be broken.”","And again another Scripture says, “They shall look on Him whom they pierced.”","And after these things Joseph from Arimathea, being a disciple of Jesus, but a hidden one for fear of the Jews, requested of Pilate that he might take the body of Jesus away; and Pilate allowed it. He came therefore and took His body away.","And Nicodemus, he who had come to Him the first time by night, came also, bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes of about a hundred pounds.","Therefore they took the body of Jesus and bound it in linen cloths with the spices, as is the custom of the Jews for burying.","Now in the place where He was crucified there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb, in which no one had ever yet been laid.","Therefore because of the day of preparation for the Jews and because the tomb was near, they laid Jesus there."],["Now on the first day of the week, Mary the Magdalene came early to the tomb while it was yet dark and saw the stone taken away from the tomb.","She ran therefore and came to Simon Peter and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved and said to them, They have taken away the Lord out of the tomb, and we do not know where they have laid Him.","Peter therefore went forth, as well as the other disciple, and came to the tomb.","And the two ran together, yet the other disciple ran ahead faster than Peter and came first to the tomb.","And stooping to look in, he saw the linen cloths lying there; however, he did not enter.","Then Simon Peter also came, following him, and entered into the tomb; and he beheld the linen cloths lying there","And the handkerchief which had been over His head, not lying with the linen cloths, but folded up in one place apart.","At that time therefore the other disciple also, who came first to the tomb, entered, and he saw and believed;","For as yet they did not understand the Scripture, that He had to rise from the dead.","The disciples therefore went away again to their own home.","But Mary stood outside at the tomb weeping. Then as she wept, she stooped to look into the tomb","And beheld two angels in white sitting, one at the head and one at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain.","And they said to her, Woman, why are you weeping? She said to them, Because they have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where they have laid Him.","When she said these things, she turned backward and beheld Jesus standing there, yet she did not know that it was Jesus.","Jesus said to her, Woman, why are you weeping? Whom are you seeking? She, supposing that He was the gardener, said to Him, Sir, if You have carried Him away, tell me where You have laid Him, and I will take Him away.","Jesus said to her, Mary! She turned and said to Him in Hebrew, Rabboni! (which means Teacher).","Jesus said to her, Do not touch Me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father; but go to My brothers and say to them, I ascend to My Father and your Father, and My God and your God.","Mary the Magdalene came, announcing to the disciples, I have seen the Lord, and that He had said these things to her.","When therefore it was evening on that day, the first day of the week, and while the doors were shut where the disciples were for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the midst and said to them, Peace be to you.","And when He had said this, He showed them His hands and His side. The disciples therefore rejoiced at seeing the Lord.","Then Jesus said to them again, Peace be to you; as the Father has sent Me, I also send you.","And when He had said this, He breathed into them and said to them, Receive the Holy Spirit.","Whose sins you forgive, they are forgiven them; and whose sins you retain, they are retained.","But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came.","The other disciples therefore said to him, We have seen the Lord! But he said to them, Unless I see in His hands the mark of the nails and put my finger into the mark of the nails and put my hand into His side, I will by no means believe.","And after eight days, His disciples were again within, and Thomas was with them. Jesus came, though the doors were shut, and stood in the midst and said, Peace be to you.","Then He said to Thomas, Bring your finger here and see My hands, and bring your hand and put it into My side; and do not be unbelieving, but believing.","Thomas answered and said to Him, My Lord and my God!","Jesus said to him, Because you have seen Me, you have believed. Blessed are those who have not seen and have believed.","Moreover indeed many other signs also Jesus did before His disciples, which are not written in this book.","But these have been written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing, you may have life in His name."],["After these things Jesus manifested Himself again to the disciples at the Sea of Tiberias.

They said to him, We also are coming with you. They went forth and got into the boat, and that night they caught nothing.","Now as soon as the morning broke, Jesus stood on the shore; however the disciples did not know that it was Jesus.","Then Jesus said to them, Little children, you do not have any fish to eat, do you? They answered Him, No.","And He said to them, Cast the net on the right side of the boat, and you will find some. They cast therefore, and they were no longer able to haul it in because of the abundance of fish.","Then that disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, It is the Lord! Therefore when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he put his outer garment around himself, for he was naked; and he threw himself into the sea.","But the other disciples came in the little boat, for they were not far from the land, but about two hundred cubits away, dragging the net of fish.","Then when they got out onto the land, they saw a fire of coals laid there, and fish lying on it and bread.","Jesus said to them, Bring some of the fish that you have just now caught.","Simon Peter therefore went up and hauled the net to the land full of large fish, a hundred and fifty-three; and though there were so many, the net was not torn.","Jesus said to them, Come and have breakfast. But none of the disciples dared to inquire of Him, Who are you? knowing that it was the Lord.","Jesus came and took the bread and gave it to them, and the fish likewise.","This was now the third time that Jesus was manifested to the disciples after He had been raised from the dead.","Then when they had eaten breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, Simon, son of John, do you love Me more than these?

He said to Him, Yes, Lord, You know that I love You. He said to him, Shepherd My sheep.","He said to him the third time, Simon, son of John, do you love Me? Peter was grieved that He said to him the third time, Do you love Me? And he said to Him, Lord, You know all things; You know that I love You. Jesus said to him, Feed My sheep.","Truly, truly, I say to you, When you were younger, you girded yourself and walked where you wished; but when you grow old, you will stretch out your hands, and another will gird you and carry you where you do not wish to go.","Now this He said, signifying by what kind of death he would glorify God. And when He had said this, He said to him, Follow Me.","Peter, turning around, saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following, who also reclined on His breast at the supper and said, Lord, who is the one betraying You?","Peter therefore, seeing him, said to Jesus, Lord, and what about this man?","Jesus said to him, If I want him to remain until I come, what is that to you? You follow Me.","This word therefore went out among the brothers, that that disciple would not die, yet Jesus did not say to him that he would not die, but, If I want him to remain until I come, what is that to you?","This is the disciple who testifies concerning these things, and the one who has written these things; and we know that his testimony is true.","And there are also many other things which Jesus did, which, if they were written one by one, I suppose that not even the world itself could contain the books written."]]
