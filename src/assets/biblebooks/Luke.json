[["Inasmuch as many have undertaken to draw up a narrative concerning the matters which have been fully accomplished among us,","Even as those who from the beginning became eyewitnesses and ministers of the word have delivered them to us,","It seemed good to me also, having carefully investigated all things from the first, to write them out for you in an orderly fashion, most excellent Theophilus,","So that you may fully know the certainty of the things concerning which you were instructed.","In the days of Herod, king of Judea, there was a certain priest named Zachariah, of the course of Abijah; and his wife was of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth.","And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord, blameless.","And they had no child, because Elizabeth was barren, and they were both advanced in their days.","And while he served as priest in the order of his course before God,","According to the custom of the priestly service, the lot fell to him to enter into the temple of the Lord and burn incense.","And all the multitude of the people were praying outside at the hour of the burning of incense.","And an angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing at the right side of the altar of incense.","And Zachariah was troubled when he saw him, and fear fell upon him.","But the angel said to him, Do not be afraid, Zachariah, because your petition has been heard, and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you shall call his name John.","And you will have joy and exultation, and many will rejoice at his birth.","For he will be great in the sight of the Lord, and he shall by no means drink wine and liquor. And he will be filled with the Holy Spirit, even from his mother’s womb,","And many of the sons of Israel he will turn to the Lord their God.","And it is he who will go before Him in the spirit and power of Elijah to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the prudence of the righteous, to prepare for the Lord a people made ready.","And Zachariah said to the angel, By what shall I know this? For I am an old man and my wife is advanced in years.","And the angel answered and said to him, I am Gabriel, who stands before God, and I was sent to speak to you and to announce the good news of these things to you.","And behold, you shall be silent and not able to speak until the day that these things happen, because you did not believe my words, which will be fulfilled in their time.","And the people were waiting for Zachariah, and they marveled at his delaying in the temple.","And when he came out, he was not able to speak to them, and they realized that he had seen a vision in the temple. And he made signs to them and remained dumb.","And when the days of his service were fulfilled, he went to his house.","And after these days Elizabeth his wife conceived and stayed in seclusion for five months, saying,","In this way has the Lord dealt with me in the days in which He looked upon me to take away my reproach among men.","And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city of Galilee named Nazareth,","To a virgin engaged to a man named Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin’s name was Mary.","And he came to her and said, Rejoice, you who have been graced! The Lord is with you.","And she was greatly troubled at this saying and began reasoning what kind of greeting this might be.","And the angel said to her, Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found grace with God.","And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you shall call His name Jesus.","He will be great and will be called Son of the Most High; and the Lord God will give to Him the throne of David His father,","And He will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of His kingdom there will be no end.","But Mary said to the angel, How will this be, since I have not known a man?","And the angel answered and said to her, The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; therefore also the holy thing which is born will be called the Son of God.","And behold, Elizabeth your relative, she also has conceived a son in her old age, and this is the sixth month for her who is called barren,","Because no word will be impossible with God.","And Mary said, Behold, the slave of the Lord. May it happen to me according to your word. And the angel departed from her.","And Mary rose up in those days and went to the hill country with haste, to a city of Judah,","And entered into the house of Zachariah and greeted Elizabeth.","And when Elizabeth heard Mary’s greeting, the baby leaped in her womb, and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit.","And she lifted up her voice with a loud cry and said, Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb!","And how has this happened to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?","For behold, when the sound of your greeting came to my ears, the baby leaped with exultation in my womb.","And blessed is she who has believed, because there will be a completion of the things spoken to her from the Lord.","And Mary said, My soul magnifies the Lord,","And my spirit has exulted in God my Savior;","Because He has looked upon the low estate of His slave. For behold, from now on all generations will count me blessed,","Because the Mighty One has done great things for me, and holy is His name.","And His mercy is unto generations and generations, unto those who fear Him.","He has exercised might with His arm; He has scattered those who are proud in the understanding of their heart.","He has brought down potentates from thrones and has exalted the humble;","The hungry He has filled with good things, and the rich He has sent away empty.","He has upheld Israel His servant to remember mercy,","Even as He spoke to our fathers, to Abraham and to his seed forever.","And Mary remained with her about three months, and returned to her home.","Now the time was fulfilled for Elizabeth to give birth, and she bore a son.","And her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had magnified His mercy with her, and they rejoiced with her.","And on the eighth day they came to circumcise the little child, and they tried to call him after the name of his father, Zachariah.","Yet his mother answered and said, No, but he shall be called John.","And they said to her, There is no one among your relatives who is called by this name.","And they gestured to his father as to what he would want him to be called.","And asking for a tablet, he wrote, saying, John is his name. And they all marveled.","And his mouth was opened instantly, and his tongue loosed, and he began to speak, blessing God.","And fear came on all those dwelling around them, and in all the hill country of Judea all these things were spread about.","And all who heard these things put them in their heart, saying, What then will this little child be? For indeed the hand of the Lord was with him.","And Zachariah his father was filled with the Holy Spirit and prophesied, saying,","Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel, because He has visited and accomplished redemption for His people,","And raised a horn of salvation for us in the house of David His servant,","Even as He spoke through the mouth of His holy prophets from of old\u00A0—","Salvation from our enemies and from the hand of all who hate us,","To accomplish mercy with our fathers and to remember His holy covenant,","The oath which He swore to Abraham our father,","To grant us that we, having been delivered out of the hand of our enemies, might serve Him without fear,","In holiness and righteousness before Him all our days.","And you also, little child, shall be called a prophet of the Most High, for you will go before the Lord to prepare His ways,","To give knowledge of salvation to His people by the forgiveness of their sins,","Because of the merciful compassions of our God, in which the rising sun will visit us from on high,","To shine upon those sitting in darkness and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace.","And the little child grew and became strong in spirit, and he was in the wilderness until the day of his presentation to Israel."],["And in those days a decree went out from Caesar Augustus for a census to be taken of all the inhabited earth.","This was the first census, which took place when Quirinius governed Syria.","And all went to be registered, each to his own city.","And Joseph also went up from Galilee out of the city of Nazareth into Judea, to David’s city, which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and family of David,","To be registered with Mary, who was engaged to him and was pregnant.","And while they were there, the days were fulfilled for her to bear,","And she bore her firstborn son; and she wrapped Him in swaddling clothes and laid Him in a manger because there was no place for them in the inn.","And there were shepherds in the same region, spending their nights in the fields and keeping watch over their flock by night.","And an angel of the Lord stood by them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them; and they feared greatly.","And the angel said to them, Do not be afraid; for behold, I announce to you good news of great joy, which will be for all the people,","Because today a Savior has been born to you in David’s city, who is Christ the Lord.","And this will be the sign to you: you will find a baby wrapped in swaddling clothes and lying in a manger.","And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly army, praising God and saying,","Glory in the highest places to God, and on earth peace among men of His good pleasure.","And when the angels departed from them into heaven, the shepherds spoke to one another, Let us go then to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has made known to us.","And they came in haste and found both Mary and Joseph, and the baby lying in the manger.","And when they had seen this, they made known the word which was spoken to them concerning this little child.","And all those who heard marveled at the things spoken to them by the shepherds.","But Mary kept all these things and pondered them in her heart.","And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things which they had heard and seen, even as it was spoken to them.","And when eight days were fulfilled to circumcise Him, His name was called Jesus, the name given by the angel before He was conceived in the womb.","And when the days for their purification according to the law of Moses were fulfilled, they brought Him up to Jerusalem to present Him to the Lord","(Even as it is written in the law of the Lord, “Every male who opens the womb shall be called holy to the Lord”),","And to give a sacrifice according to what is said in the law of the Lord: A pair of turtledoves or two young doves.","And behold, there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon. And this man was righteous and devout, waiting for the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was upon him.","And it had been divinely communicated to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not see death before he had seen the Lord’s Christ.","And he came in the Spirit into the temple; and when the parents brought in the little child Jesus for them to do according to the custom of the law concerning Him,","He received Him into his arms and blessed God and said,","Now You release Your slave, Master, according to Your word, in peace;","For my eyes have seen Your salvation,","Which You have prepared before the face of all the peoples,","A light for revelation to the Gentiles and the glory of Your people Israel.","And His father and mother marveled at the things being spoken about Him.","And Simeon blessed them and said to Mary His mother, Behold, this One is appointed for the falling and rising up of many in Israel and for a sign spoken against\u00A0— ","And a sword will pierce through your own soul also\u00A0— so that the reasonings of many hearts may be revealed.","And there was one Anna, a prophetess, a daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher. She was well advanced in years, having lived with her husband seven years from her virginity,","And she was a widow up to the age of eighty-four, who did not depart from the temple, serving God with fastings and petitions night and day.","And at that very hour she came up and returned thanks to God, and spoke concerning Him to all those waiting for the redemption of Jerusalem.","And when they had finished all things according to the law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee, to their own city, Nazareth.","And the little child grew and became strong, being filled with wisdom, and the grace of God was upon Him.","And His parents went year by year to Jerusalem at the Feast of the Passover.","And when He became twelve years old, they went up according to the custom of the feast.","And when they had completed the days, while they were returning, the boy Jesus remained behind in Jerusalem, and His parents did not know it.","But supposing that He was in the company, they went a day’s journey and sought Him among their relatives and acquaintances.","And when they did not find Him, they returned to Jerusalem searching for Him.","And after three days they found Him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the teachers, both hearing them and questioning them.","And all those who heard Him were amazed at His understanding and His answers.","And when they saw Him, they were astounded; and His mother said to Him, Child, why have You treated us like this? Behold, Your father and I, being greatly distressed, have been seeking You.","And He said to them, Why is it that you were seeking Me? Did you not know that I must be in the things of My Father?","And they did not understand the word which He spoke to them.","And He went down with them and came to Nazareth, and was subject to them. And His mother carefully kept all these things in her heart.","And Jesus advanced in wisdom and stature and in the grace manifested in Him before God and men."],["Now in the fifteenth year of the government of Tiberius Caesar, while Pontius Pilate was governor of Judea, and Herod was tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip was tetrarch of the region of Ituraea and Trachonitis, and Lysanias was tetrarch of Abilene,","During the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came to John the son of Zachariah in the wilderness.","And he came into all the region surrounding the Jordan, proclaiming a baptism of repentance for forgiveness of sins,","As it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet, “A voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare the way of the Lord; make straight His paths.","Every ravine shall be filled up, and every mountain and hill shall be leveled; and the crooked places shall become a straight way, and the rough ways smooth.","And all flesh shall see the salvation of God.”","He said therefore to the crowds going out to be baptized by him, Offspring of vipers, who prompted you to flee from the coming wrath?","Produce then fruits worthy of your repentance, and do not begin to say within yourselves, We have Abraham as our father; for I tell you that God is able out of these stones to raise up children to Abraham.","And already also the axe is laid at the root of the trees. Every tree therefore that does not produce good fruit is cut down and cast into the fire.","And the crowds asked him, saying, What then shall we do?","And he answered and said to them, He who has two tunics, let him share with the one who has none; and he who has food, let him do likewise.","And tax collectors also came to be baptized, and they said to him, Teacher, what shall we do?","And he said to them, Exact nothing more than what you have been ordered to.","And some serving in the military also questioned him, saying, And we, what shall we do? And he said to them, Extort nothing from anyone by force, nor take anything by false accusation, and be content with your wages.","Now while the people were in expectation and all were reasoning in their hearts concerning John, whether he might possibly be the Christ,","John answered and said to all, I baptize you in water, but He who is stronger than I is coming, the thong of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie. He Himself will baptize you in the Holy Spirit and fire,","Whose winnowing fan is in His hand to thoroughly cleanse His threshing floor and to gather the wheat into His barn, but the chaff He will burn up with unquenchable fire.","So, exhorting them with many other things also, he announced the gospel to the people.","But Herod the tetrarch, because he was reproved by him concerning Herodias, his brother’s wife, and concerning all the evil things which Herod did,","Added this also above all: he shut John up in prison.","Now when all the people were baptized and as Jesus was baptized and was praying, heaven was opened,","And the Holy Spirit descended in bodily form as a dove upon Him. And a voice came out of heaven: You are My Son, the Beloved; in You I have found My delight.","And He, Jesus, when He began to minister, was about thirty years old, being, so it was thought, the son of Joseph, the son of Heli,","The son of Matthat, the son of Levi, the son of Melchi, the son of Jannai, the son of Joseph,","The son of Mattathias, the son of Amos, the son of Nahum, the son of Esli, the son of Naggai,","The son of Maath, the son of Mattathias, the son of Semein, the son of Josech, the son of Joda,","The son of Joanan, the son of Rhesa, the son of Zerubbabel, the son of Salathiel, the son of Neri,","The son of Melchi, the son of Addi, the son of Cosam, the son of Elmadam, the son of Er,","The son of Joshua, the son of Eliezer, the son of Jorim, the son of Matthat, the son of Levi,","The son of Simeon, the son of Judah, the son of Joseph, the son of Jonam, the son of Eliakim,","The son of Melea, the son of Menna, the son of Mattatha, the son of Nathan, the son of David,","The son of Jesse, the son of Obed, the son of Boaz, the son of Salmon, the son of Nahshon,","The son of Aminadab, the son of Aram, the son of Hezron, the son of Pharez, the son of Judah,","The son of Jacob, the son of Isaac, the son of Abraham, the son of Terah, the son of Nahor,","The son of Serug, the son of Reu, the son of Peleg, the son of Eber, the son of Sala,","The son of Cainan, the son of Arphaxad, the son of Shem, the son of Noah, the son of Lamech,","The son of Methuselah, the son of Enoch, the son of Jared, the son of Maleleel, the son of Cainan,","The son of Enosh, the son of Seth, the son of Adam, the son of God."],["And Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan and was led by the Spirit in the wilderness, while being tempted for forty days by the devil.","And He did not eat anything in those days, and when they were concluded, He became hungry.","And the devil said to Him, If You are the Son of God, speak to this stone that it become bread.","And Jesus answered him, It is written, “Man shall not live on bread alone.”","And he led Him up and showed Him all the kingdoms of the inhabited earth in a moment of time.","And the devil said to Him, To You I will give all this authority and their glory, because to me it has been delivered, and to whomever I want I give it.","If You therefore worship before me, it shall all be Yours.","And Jesus answered and said to him, It is written, “You shall worship the Lord your God, and Him only shall you serve.”","And he led Him into Jerusalem and set Him on the wing of the temple and said to Him, If You are the Son of God, cast Yourself down from here;","For it is written, “To His angels He shall give charge concerning You to protect You,","And on their hands they shall bear You up, lest You strike Your foot against a stone.”","And Jesus answered and said to him, It is said, “You shall not test the Lord your God.”","And when the devil had concluded every temptation, he went away from Him until an opportune time.","And Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee.

And the eyes of all in the synagogue were fixed on Him.","And He began to say to them, Today this Scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing.","And all bore witness to Him and marveled at the words of grace proceeding out of His mouth, and they said, Is not this Joseph’s son?","And He said to them, Surely you will say this proverb to Me, Physician, heal yourself! What we heard happening in Capernaum, do here also in Your own country.","And He said, Truly I say to you that no prophet is acceptable in his own country.","But in truth I say to you, There were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah, when the sky was shut up for three years and six months, when a great famine came over all the land;","And to none of them was Elijah sent, except to the city of Sarepta of Sidon, to a woman who was a widow.","And there were many lepers in Israel during the time of Elisha the prophet, and none of them were cleansed, except Naaman the Syrian.","And all in the synagogue were filled with anger when they heard these things,","And they rose up and cast Him out of the city and led Him to the brow of the hill on which their city was built so that they might throw Him down the cliff.","But He, passing through their midst, went away.","And He came down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee. And He taught them on the Sabbath.","And they were astounded at His teaching, because His word was with authority.","And in the synagogue there was a man who had a spirit of an unclean demon, and he cried out with a loud voice,","Ah! What do we have to do with You, Jesus, Nazarene? Have You come to destroy us? I know who You are\u00A0— the Holy One of God.","And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Be quiet and come out from him.

Who can forgive sins except God alone?","But Jesus, knowing fully their reasonings, answered and said to them, Why are you reasoning in your hearts?","Which is easier: to say, Your sins are forgiven you, or to say, Rise and walk?","But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on the earth to forgive sins\u00A0— He said to the one paralyzed, To you I say, Rise and take up your cot and go to your house.","And he rose up at once before them and took up that upon which he was lying and went away to his house, glorifying God.","And astonishment took hold of all, and they glorified God and were filled with fear, saying, We have seen extraordinary things today.","And after these things He went out and beheld a tax collector named Levi sitting at the tax office, and He said to him, Follow Me.","And leaving all, he rose up and followed Him.","And Levi gave a great reception for Him in his house; and there was a great crowd of tax collectors and others who were reclining at table with them.","And the Pharisees and their scribes murmured at His disciples, saying, Why do you eat and drink with the tax collectors and sinners?","And Jesus answered and said to them, Those who are healthy have no need of a physician, but those who are ill;","I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.","And they said to Him, The disciples of John fast often and make petitions, likewise also those of the Pharisees, but Yours eat and drink.","And Jesus said to them, You cannot make the sons of the bridechamber fast while the bridegroom is with them, can you?","But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them; then they will fast in those days.","And He also spoke a parable to them: No one tears a patch from a new garment and puts it on an old garment; otherwise, he will tear the new garment, and also the patch from the new will not match the old.","And no one puts new wine into old wineskins; otherwise, the new wine will burst the wineskins, and it will be poured out and the wineskins will be ruined;","But new wine must be put into fresh wineskins.","And no one who has drunk the old desires the new, for he says, The old is better."],["And one Sabbath He was going through the grainfields, and His disciples were picking and eating the ears of grain, rubbing them in their hands.","And some of the Pharisees said, Why are you doing what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath?","And Jesus answered them and said, Have you not even read this that David did when he became hungry, he and those who were with him;","How he entered into the house of God, and taking the bread of the Presence, he ate it and gave some to those with him, which is not lawful for anyone to eat except the priests alone?","And He said to them, The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.","And on another Sabbath He entered into the synagogue and taught.

Even sinners do the same.","And if you lend to those from whom you hope to receive, what thanks is it to you? Even sinners lend to sinners that they may get back the equal amount.","But love your enemies, and do good and lend, expecting nothing in return, and your reward will be great, and you will be sons of the Most High; for He is kind to the unthankful and evil.","Be full of compassion, even as your Father also is full of compassion.","And do not judge, and you shall by no means be judged; and do not condemn, and you shall by no means be condemned; release, and you will be released;","Give, and it will be given to you; a good measure, pressed down, shaken together, and running over, they will give into your bosom.

Will not both fall into a pit?","A disciple is not above the teacher, but everyone who has been perfected will be like his teacher.","And why do you look at the splinter which is in your brother’s eye, but the beam which is in your own eye you do not consider?","How can you say to your brother, Brother, let me remove the splinter which is in your eye, you yourself not seeing the beam which is in your eye? Hypocrite, first remove the beam from your eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the splinter which is in your brother’s eye.","For there is no good tree that produces corrupt fruit, nor again a corrupt tree that produces good fruit.","For each tree is known by its own fruit. For men do not collect figs from thorns, nor do they pick grapes from a thornbush.","The good man, out of the good treasure of his heart, brings forth that which is good, and the evil man, out of the evil treasure of his heart, brings forth that which is evil; for out of the abundance of his heart his mouth speaks.","And why do you call Me, Lord, Lord, and do not do the things that I say?","Everyone who comes to Me and hears My words and does them, I will show you whom he is like.","He is like a man building a house, who dug and went deep and laid a foundation on the rock. And when a flood came, the river broke out against that house, yet it was not strong enough to shake it, because it had been built well.","But he who hears and does not do is like a man who built a house upon the earth without a foundation, against which the river broke out, and immediately it collapsed, and the crash of that house was great."],["After He completed all His words in the hearing of the people, He entered into Capernaum.","And a certain centurion’s slave, who was highly valued by him, was ill and about to die.","And when he heard about Jesus, he sent to Him some elders of the Jews, requesting that He would come and completely heal his slave.","And when they came to Jesus, they entreated Him earnestly, saying, He is worthy of Your granting this to him,","For he loves our nation, and he himself built the synagogue for us.","And Jesus went with them. But already, when He was not far from the house, the centurion sent friends, saying to Him, Lord, do not trouble Yourself, for I am not fit for You to enter under my roof;","Therefore, I did not count even myself worthy to come to You. But speak a word, and let my servant be healed.","For I also am a man set under authority, having soldiers under me. And I say to this one, Go, and he goes; and to another, Come, and he comes; and to my slave, Do this, and he does it.","And when Jesus heard these things, He marveled at him, and turning to the crowd following Him, He said, I say to you, Not even in Israel have I found such great faith.","And when those who had been sent returned to the house, they found the slave in good health.","And soon afterward He went into a city called Nain, and His disciples went with Him, as well as a large crowd.","And as He came near the gate of the city, behold, one who had died was being carried out, an only son of his mother, and she was a widow; and a considerable crowd from the city was with her.","And when the Lord saw her, He was moved with compassion for her and said to her, Do not weep.","And He came near and touched the bier, and those carrying it stood still. And He said, Young man, to you I say, Arise.","And the dead man sat up and began to speak. And He gave him to his mother.","And fear took hold of all, and they glorified God, saying, A great prophet has been raised up among us, and, God has visited His people!","And this report concerning Him went out in the whole of Judea and in all the surrounding region.","And John’s disciples reported to him concerning all these things.","And John called a certain two of his disciples to him and sent them to the Lord, saying, Are You the Coming One, or should we expect another?","And the men came to Him and said, John the Baptist sent us to You, saying, Are You the Coming One, or should we expect another?","In that hour He healed many from diseases and afflictions and evil spirits, and to many who were blind He graciously gave sight.","And He answered and said to them, Go and report to John what you have seen and heard: the blind receive their sight, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed and the deaf hear, the dead are raised, the poor have the gospel announced to them.","And blessed is he who is not stumbled because of Me.","And when the messengers of John went away, He began to say to the crowds concerning John, What did you go out into the wilderness to look at? A reed shaken by the wind?","But what did you go out to see? A man arrayed in soft garments? Behold, those who live in splendid apparel and luxury are in royal palaces.","But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I say to you, and much more than a prophet.","This is he concerning whom it is written, “Behold, I send My messenger before Your face, who will prepare Your way before You.”","I say to you, Among those born of women there is no one greater than John, yet he who is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.","And when all the people and the tax collectors heard this, they acknowledged that God was righteous, since they had been baptized with the baptism of John.","But the Pharisees and the lawyers rejected the counsel of God for themselves since they had not been baptized by him.","And Jesus said, To what then shall I liken the men of this generation, and what are they like?","They are like little children sitting in the marketplace and calling to one another, who say, We have played the flute to you, and you did not dance; we have sung a dirge, and you did not weep.","For John the Baptist has come neither eating bread nor drinking wine, and you say, He has a demon.","The Son of Man has come eating and drinking, and you say, Behold, a gluttonous man and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners.","Yet wisdom is justified by all her children.","Now a certain one of the Pharisees asked Him to eat with him. And He entered into the Pharisee’s house and reclined at table.","And behold, there was a woman in the city who was a sinner, and when she learned that He was reclining at table in the Pharisee’s house, she brought an alabaster flask of ointment.","And she stood behind Him at His feet weeping and began to wet His feet with her tears and wiped them with the hair of her head, and she kissed His feet affectionately and anointed them with the ointment.","But when the Pharisee who had invited Him saw this, he said within himself, This man, if He were a prophet, would know who and what sort of woman this is who is touching Him, because she is a sinner.","And Jesus answered and said to him, Simon, I have something to say to you. And he said, Teacher, say it.","A certain moneylender had two debtors: one owed five hundred denarii and the other fifty.","But since they had nothing with which to repay, he graciously forgave them both. Which of them therefore will love him more?","Simon answered and said, I suppose the one whom he graciously forgave the more. And He said to him, You have judged correctly.","And turning to the woman, He said to Simon, Do you see this woman? I entered into your house; you did not give Me water for My feet, but she, with her tears, has wet My feet and with her hair has wiped them.","You did not give Me a kiss, but she, from the time I entered, has not stopped kissing My feet affectionately.","You did not anoint My head with oil, but she has anointed My feet with ointment.","For this reason I say to you, Her sins which are many are forgiven, because she loved much; but to whom little is forgiven, he loves little.","And He said to her, Your sins are forgiven.","And those who were reclining at table with Him began to say within themselves, Who is this who even forgives sins?","But He said to the woman, Your faith has saved you. Go in peace."],["And soon afterward He journeyed from city to city and village to village, preaching and announcing the gospel of the kingdom of God; and the twelve were with Him,","As well as certain women who were healed of evil spirits and infirmities: Mary, who was called Magdalene, from whom seven demons had gone out,","And Joanna, the wife of Chuza, Herod’s steward, and Susanna, and many other women, who ministered to them out of their possessions.","And while a great crowd was coming together and those from city to city were journeying to Him, He spoke by way of a parable:","The sower went out to sow his seed. And as he sowed, some seed fell beside the way, and it was trampled underfoot, and the birds of heaven devoured it.","And other seed fell on the rock, and as it grew, it withered because it had no moisture.","And other seed fell in the midst of the thorns, and the thorns grew with it and choked it off.","And other seed fell into the good earth, and when it grew, it produced fruit a hundredfold. When He had said these things, He called out, He who has ears to hear, let him hear.","And His disciples questioned Him as to what this parable might be.","And He said, To you it has been given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God, but to the rest they are in parables, in order that seeing they may not see, and hearing they may not understand.","Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.","And those beside the way are those who heard; then the devil comes and takes away the word from their heart, so that they would not believe and be saved.","And those on the rock are those who, when they hear, receive the word with joy; yet these have no root, who believe only for a while, and in time of trial they draw back.","And that which fell into the thorns, these are those who heard and, going away, are utterly choked by anxieties and riches and pleasures of this life, and do not bring any fruit to maturity.","But that which is in the good earth, these are those who in a noble and good heart hear the word and hold it fast and bear fruit with endurance.","Now no one who has lit a lamp covers it with a vessel or puts it underneath a bed, but he puts it on a lampstand in order that those who come in may see the light.","For nothing is hidden which shall not become manifest, nor concealed which shall not by all means be made known and come into the open.","Take heed therefore how you hear, for whoever has, it shall be given to him, and whoever does not have, even what he thinks he has shall be taken away from him.","And His mother and brothers came up to Him and were not able to get to Him because of the crowd.","And it was reported to Him, Your mother and Your brothers are standing outside wanting to see You.","But He answered and said to them, My mother and My brothers are these who hear the word of God and do it.","And on one of the days He and His disciples got into a boat. And He said to them, Let us go over to the other side of the lake. And they launched out.","And while they were sailing, He fell asleep. And a windstorm came down upon the lake, and they began to fill with water and were in danger.","And they came to Him and woke Him, saying, Master, Master, we are perishing! And being awakened, He rebuked the wind and the surging of the water, and they ceased, and there was a calm.","And He said to them, Where is your faith? And they became frightened and marveled, saying to one another, Who then is this, that He orders even the winds and the water, and they obey Him?","And they sailed down to the region of the Gerasenes, which is across from Galilee.","And when He went out onto the land, a certain man out of the city, who had demons, met Him, and for a considerable time he had not put on clothes and did not remain in a house but among the tombs.","And when he saw Jesus, he cried out and fell before Him and said in a loud voice, What do I have to do with You, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beseech You, do not torment me.","For He had charged the unclean spirit to come out from the man; for many times it had seized him and he had been bound with chains and shackles and was kept under watch, yet every time he tore the bonds apart and was driven by the demon into the wilderness.","And Jesus questioned him, What is your name? And he said, Legion, because many demons had entered into him.","And they entreated Him not to order them to depart into the abyss.","Now there was a herd of many hogs feeding there on the mountain. And they entreated Him to permit them to enter into them, and He gave them permission.","And the demons came out from the man and entered into the hogs, and the herd rushed down the steep slope into the lake and was drowned.","And when those who were feeding them saw what had happened, they fled and reported it in the city and in the countryside.","And the people went out to see what had happened. And they came to Jesus and found the man from whom the demons had come out, sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed and sane, and they became frightened.","And those who had seen it reported to them how the demon-possessed man had been healed.","And all the multitude from the surrounding region of the Gerasenes asked Him to depart from them, for they were seized with great fear; and He got into a boat and returned.","And the man from whom the demons had come out begged to be with Him, but He sent him away, saying,","Return to your house, and relate what great things God has done for you. And he departed, proclaiming throughout the whole city what great things Jesus had done for him.","Now as Jesus was returning, the crowd welcomed Him, for they were all waiting for Him.","And behold, a man came whose name was Jairus, and this man was a ruler of the synagogue. And he fell at Jesus’ feet and entreated Him to enter into his house,","Because he had an only daughter, about twelve years old, and she was dying. And as He went, the crowds pressed against Him.","And a woman who had a flow of blood for twelve years and who had spent all her livelihood on physicians and yet could not be healed by anyone,","Approached Him from behind and touched the fringe of His garment, and instantly her flow of blood stopped.","And Jesus said, Who is the one who touched Me? And when all denied it, Peter said, Master, the crowds are pressing and crushing You.","But Jesus said, Someone touched Me, for I perceived that power had gone out from Me.","And when the woman saw that she had not escaped notice, she came trembling and fell down before Him and declared before all the people the reason why she had touched Him and how she had been instantly healed.","And He said to her, Daughter, your faith has healed you. Go in peace.","While He was still speaking, someone came from the house of the ruler of the synagogue, saying, Your daughter has died; do not trouble the Teacher any longer.","But Jesus, hearing it, answered him, Do not be afraid\u00A0— only believe, and she will be healed.","And He came to the house and did not allow anyone to enter with Him, except Peter and John and James and the father of the child and the mother.","And all were weeping and mourning for her; but He said, Do not weep, for she has not died but is sleeping.","And they laughed scornfully at Him, knowing that she had died.","But He took hold of her hand and called out, saying, Child, arise!","And her spirit returned and she rose up instantly; and He directed that something be given to her to eat.","And her parents were amazed, but He charged them to tell no one what had happened."],["And He called together the twelve and gave them power and authority over all the demons and to heal diseases.","And He sent them to proclaim the kingdom of God and to heal the sick.","And He said to them, Take nothing for the journey, neither a staff nor a bag nor bread nor money, nor have two tunics apiece.","And into whatever house you enter, remain there and from there go out.","And as many as do not receive you, as you go out from that city, shake off the dust from your feet for a testimony against them.","And they went out and passed through village after village, announcing the gospel and healing everywhere.","And Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was happening and was utterly perplexed, because it was said by some that John had been raised from the dead,","And by some that Elijah had appeared, and by others that a certain prophet of the ancients had risen up.","And Herod said, John I beheaded, but who is this concerning whom I hear such things? And he sought to see Him.","And when the apostles returned, they related to Him the things they had done. And taking them aside, He withdrew privately into a city called Bethsaida.","But the crowds found out and followed Him, and He welcomed them and spoke to them concerning the kingdom of God; and those who had need of healing He healed.","And the day began to decline, and the twelve came and said to Him, Send the crowd away so that they may go into the surrounding villages and countryside to lodge and find provisions, because we are here in a deserted place.","But He said to them, You give them something to eat. But they said, We have no more than five loaves and two fish, unless we go and buy food for all these people.","For there were about five thousand men. And He said to His disciples, Make them recline in groups of about fifty each.","And they did so and made them all recline.","And He took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, He blessed and broke them and gave them to the disciples to set before the crowd.","And they ate and were all satisfied. And what was left over among them was taken up, twelve handbaskets of broken pieces.","And as He was praying alone, the disciples were with Him, and He questioned them, saying, Who do the crowds say that I am?","And they answered and said, John the Baptist, and others Elijah, and others that a certain prophet of the ancients has risen up.","And He said to them, But you, who do you say that I am? And Peter answered and said, The Christ of God.","But He charged them and commanded them to tell this to no one,","Saying, The Son of Man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and on the third day be raised.","And He said to them all, If anyone wants to come after Me, let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow Me.","For whoever wants to save his soul-life shall lose it; but whoever loses his soul-life for My sake, this one shall save it.","For what is a man profited if he gains the whole world but loses or forfeits himself?","For whoever is ashamed of Me and of My words, of this one will the Son of Man be ashamed when He comes in His glory and the glory of the Father and of the holy angels.","But I say to you truly, There are some of those standing here who shall by no means taste death until they see the kingdom of God.","And about eight days after these words, He took with Him Peter and John and James, and went up into the mountain to pray.","And as He prayed, the appearance of His face became different, and His garment dazzling white.","And behold, two men were conversing with Him, who were Moses and Elijah,","Who appeared in glory and spoke of His departure, which He was about to complete in Jerusalem.","Now Peter and those with him had been overcome with sleep, but when they had fully woken up, they saw His glory and the two men who were standing with Him.","And as they were departing from Him, Peter said to Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here; and let us make three tents, one for You and one for Moses and one for Elijah\u00A0— not knowing what he was saying.","And while he said these things, a cloud appeared and overshadowed them; and they became frightened as they entered into the cloud.","And a voice came out of the cloud, saying, This is My Son, the Chosen One. Hear Him!","And when the voice had spoken, Jesus was found alone. And they kept silent and reported to no one in those days anything of what they had seen.","And on the following day, when they came down from the mountain, a great crowd met Him.","And behold, a man from the crowd called out, saying, Teacher, I beg You to look upon my son, for he is my only child.","And behold, a spirit takes him, and suddenly he cries out, and it throws him into convulsions with foaming; and it hardly goes away from him, all the time crushing him.","And I begged Your disciples to cast it out, and they could not.","And Jesus answered and said, O unbelieving and perverted generation! How long shall I be with you and bear with you? Bring your son here.","And just as he was coming to Him, the demon threw him down and greatly convulsed him. But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit and healed the child and gave him back to his father.","And all were astounded at the majesty of God. And while all were marveling at all the things which He did, He said to His disciples,","Put these words into your ears; for the Son of Man is about to be delivered into the hands of men.","But they did not understand this saying, and it was concealed from them so that they would not perceive it; and they were afraid to ask Him concerning this saying.","And reasoning came in among them as to which of them was greatest.","And Jesus, seeing the reasoning of their heart, took hold of a little child and stood him beside Himself,","And He said to them, Whoever receives this little child because of My name receives Me; and whoever receives Me receives Him who sent Me; for he who is least among you all, this one is great.","And John answered and said, Master, we saw someone casting out demons in Your name, and we forbade him because he does not follow with us.","But Jesus said to him, Do not forbid him, for he who is not against you is for you.","And as the days were being fulfilled for Him to be taken up, He steadfastly set His face to go to Jerusalem.","And He sent messengers before His face. And they went and entered into a village of the Samaritans to prepare for Him.","And they did not receive Him, because His face was set to go to Jerusalem.","And seeing this, the disciples James and John said, Lord, do You want us to command fire to come down from heaven and consume them?","But turning, He rebuked them and said, You do not know of what kind of spirit you are.","The Son of Man has not come to destroy men’s lives but to save them. And they went into another village.","And as they went along the road, someone said to Him, I will follow You wherever You go.","And Jesus said to him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of heaven have roosts, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay His head.","And He said to another, Follow Me. But he said, Lord, permit me to go first and bury my father.","But He said to him, Let the dead bury their own dead, but you go and announce the kingdom of God everywhere.","And another also said, I will follow You, Lord; but first permit me to say farewell to those in my house.","But Jesus said to him, No one who puts his hand on the plow and looks behind is fit for the kingdom of God."],["Now after these things, the Lord appointed seventy others and sent them two by two before His face into every city and place where He Himself was about to come.","And He said to them, The harvest is great, but the workers few; therefore, beseech the Lord of the harvest that He would thrust out workers into His harvest.","Go; behold, I send you as lambs in the midst of wolves.","Do not carry a purse, nor a bag, nor sandals; and greet no one on the way.","And into whatever house you enter, first say, Peace to this house.","And if a son of peace is there, your peace shall rest upon it; but if not, it shall return upon you.","And in that house remain, eating and drinking the things from them, for the worker is worthy of his wages. Do not move from house to house.","And into whatever city you enter and they receive you, eat what is set before you;","And heal the sick who are in it and say to them, The kingdom of God has drawn near to you.","But into whatever city you enter and they do not receive you, go out into its streets and say,","Even the dust from your city which clings to our feet, we wipe off against you; yet know this, that the kingdom of God has drawn near.","I say to you that it will be more tolerable for Sodom in that day than for that city.","Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the works of power which took place in you had taken place in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.","Yet it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the judgment than for you.","And you, Capernaum, who have been exalted to heaven, to Hades you will be brought down.","He who hears you hears Me, and he who rejects you rejects Me, and he who rejects Me rejects Him who sent Me.","And the seventy returned with joy, saying, Lord, even the demons are subject to us in Your name.","And He said to them, I was watching Satan fall like lightning out of heaven.","Behold, I have given you the authority to tread upon serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy, and nothing shall by any means hurt you.","However do not rejoice in this, that the spirits are subject to you, but rejoice that your names are recorded in the heavens.","In that hour He exulted in the Holy Spirit and said, I extol You, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because You have hidden these things from the wise and intelligent and have revealed them to babes. Yes, Father, for thus it has been well pleasing in Your sight.","All things have been delivered to Me by My Father; and no one knows who the Son is except the Father, and who the Father is except the Son and him to whom the Son wills to reveal Him.","And turning to the disciples, He said privately, Blessed are the eyes which see the things that you see.","For I tell you that many prophets and kings have wanted to perceive the things that you see, and have not perceived them, and to hear the things that you hear, and have not heard them.","And behold, a certain lawyer stood up and put Him to the test, saying, Teacher, what should I do to inherit eternal life?","And He said to him, What is written in the law? How do you read it?","And he answered and said, “You shall love the Lord your God from your whole heart and with your whole soul and with your whole strength and with your whole mind, and your neighbor as yourself.”","And He said to him, You have answered correctly; do this, and you shall have life.","But he, wanting to justify himself, said to Jesus, And who is my neighbor?","Jesus, taking up the question, said, A certain man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and he fell among robbers, who having both stripped him and beaten him, went away, leaving him half dead.","And by coincidence a certain priest was going down on that road; and when he saw him, he passed by on the opposite side.","And likewise also a Levite, when he came to the place and saw him, passed by on the opposite side.","But a certain Samaritan, who was journeying, came upon him; and when he saw him, he was moved with compassion;","And he came to him and bound up his wounds and poured oil and wine on them. And placing him on his own beast, he brought him to an inn and took care of him.","And on the next day he took out two denarii and gave them to the innkeeper and said, Take care of him; and whatever you spend in addition to this, when I return, I will repay you.","Which of these three, does it seem to you, has become a neighbor to him who fell into the hands of the robbers?","And he said, The one who showed mercy to him. And Jesus said to him, Go, and you do likewise.","Now as they went, He entered into a certain village, and a certain woman named Martha received Him into her home.","And she had a sister called Mary, who also sat at the Lord’s feet and was listening to His word.","But Martha was being drawn about with much serving, and she came up to Him and said, Lord, does it not matter to You that my sister has left me to serve alone? Tell her then to do her part with me.","But the Lord answered and said to her, Martha, Martha, you are anxious and troubled about many things;","But there is need of one thing, for Mary has chosen the good part, which shall not be taken away from her."],["And while He was in a certain place praying, when He ceased, a certain one of His disciples said to Him, Lord, teach us to pray, even as John also taught his disciples.","And He said to them, When you pray, say, Father, Your name be sanctified; Your kingdom come.","Give us each day our daily bread.","And forgive us our sins, for we also forgive everyone indebted to us. And do not bring us into temptation.","And He said to them, Who among you will have a friend and will go to him at midnight and say to him, Friend, lend me three loaves,","Since a friend of mine has come to me from a journey and I have nothing to set before him;","And that one, from inside, will answer and say, Do not trouble me; the door is already shut and my children are with me in bed; I cannot rise up and give you anything?","I say to you, Even though he will not rise up and give him anything because he is his friend, surely because of his shameless persistence he will rise and give him what he needs.","And I say to you, Ask and it shall be given to you; seek and you shall find; knock and it shall be opened to you.","For everyone who asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks it shall be opened.","But what father among you whose son shall ask for a fish will instead of a fish hand him a snake?","Or if he shall also ask for an egg will hand him a scorpion?","If you then being evil know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will the Father who is from heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who ask Him!","And once He was casting out a demon, and it was dumb. And when the demon had gone out, the dumb man spoke, and the crowds marveled.","But some of them said, By Beelzebul, the ruler of the demons, He casts out the demons.","And others, tempting Him, sought from Him a sign out of heaven.","But He, knowing their thoughts, said to them, Every kingdom divided against itself becomes desolate, and a house divided against a house falls.","And if Satan also is divided against himself, how shall his kingdom stand? For you say that it is by Beelzebul that I cast out the demons.","But if I by Beelzebul cast out the demons, by whom do your sons cast them out? Therefore they shall be your judges.","But if I by the finger of God cast out the demons, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.","When the strong man, fully armed, guards his own homestead, his possessions are in peace.","But when one stronger than he comes upon him and overcomes him, he takes away his whole armor in which he had trusted and distributes his spoil.","He who is not with Me is against Me, and he who does not gather with Me scatters.","When the unclean spirit goes out from the man, it roams through waterless places, seeking rest, and not finding it, it says, I will return to my house from which I came out.","And it comes and finds it swept and decorated.","Then it goes and takes along other spirits more evil than itself, seven of them, and they enter and settle down there. And the last state of that man becomes worse than the first.","And as He said these things, a certain woman out of the crowd lifted up her voice and said to Him, Blessed is the womb that bore You and the breasts at which You nursed.","But He said, Blessed rather are those who hear the word of God and keep it.","And as the crowds were thronging together, He began to say, This generation is an evil generation; it seeks a sign, and a sign shall not be given to it except the sign of Jonah.","For even as Jonah became a sign to the Ninevites, so also will the Son of Man be to this generation.","The queen of the south will rise up in the judgment with the men of this generation and will condemn them, because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold, something more than Solomon is here.","Ninevite men will stand up in the judgment with this generation and will condemn it, because they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and behold, something more than Jonah is here.","No one, after lighting a lamp, puts it in the cellar or under the bushel, but on the lampstand, in order that those who enter in may see the light.","The lamp of the body is your eye. When your eye is single, your whole body also is full of light; but when it is evil, your body also is dark.","Watch out therefore that the light which is in you is not darkness.","If therefore your whole body is full of light and does not have any dark part, the whole will be full of light as when the lamp with its rays illuminates you.","Now as He spoke, a Pharisee asked Him to have the morning meal with him; and He went in and reclined at table.","But the Pharisee, seeing it, marveled that He had not first washed before the meal.","But the Lord said to him, Again, you Pharisees cleanse the outside of the cup and of the platter, but your inside is full of extortion and wickedness.","Foolish ones!

And he said to him, Take your bill and sit down quickly and write fifty.","Then to another he said, And you, how much do you owe? And he said, A hundred measures of wheat. He said to him, Take your bill and write eighty.","And the master praised the unrighteous steward because he had acted prudently; for the sons of this age are more prudent in their dealings with their own generation than the sons of light.","And I say to you, Make friends for yourselves by means of the mammon of unrighteousness, so that when it fails, they may receive you into the eternal tabernacles.","He who is faithful in the least is faithful also in much; and he who is unrighteous in the least is unrighteous also in much.","If therefore you have not become faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will entrust to you what is true?","And if you have not become faithful in that which belongs to another, who will give to you that which is your own?","No household servant can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will hold to one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon.","And the Pharisees, being lovers of money, heard all these things and were sneering at Him.","And He said to them, You are those who justify yourselves in the sight of men, but God knows your hearts; for that which is exalted among men is an abomination in the sight of God.","The law and the prophets were until John; from that time the kingdom of God is proclaimed as the gospel, and everyone forces his way into it.","But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for one serif of the law to fail.","Everyone who divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery, and he who marries a woman who is divorced from her husband commits adultery.","Now there was a certain rich man, and he clothed himself in purple and fine linen, making merry every day in splendor.","And a certain beggar named Lazarus was laid at his gate, covered with sores","And longing to be satisfied with the things falling from the rich man’s table; moreover, even the dogs came and licked his sores.","And the beggar died, and he was carried away by the angels into Abraham’s bosom; and the rich man also died and was buried.","And in Hades he lifted up his eyes, being in torment, and saw Abraham from afar and Lazarus in his bosom.","And he called out and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue, because I am in anguish in this flame.","But Abraham said, Child, remember that in your lifetime you fully received your good things, and Lazarus likewise bad things; but now he is comforted here, and you are in anguish.","And besides all these things, between us and you a great chasm is fixed, so that those wanting to pass from here to you cannot, neither from there to us may any cross over.","And he said, Then I ask you, Father, to send him to the house of my father\u00A0—","For I have five brothers\u00A0— so that he may solemnly testify to them, lest they also come to this place of torment.","But Abraham said, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them.","But he said, No, Father Abraham; but if someone risen from the dead would go to them, they will repent.","But he said to him, If they do not hear Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded if someone rises from the dead."],["And He said to His disciples, It is impossible for causes of stumbling not to come, but woe to him through whom they come.","It is more profitable for him if a millstone is put around his neck and he is hurled into the sea than to stumble one of these little ones.","Take heed to yourselves. If your brother sins, rebuke him; and if he repents, forgive him.","And if he sins against you seven times in a day and turns again to you seven times, saying, I repent, you shall forgive him.","And the apostles said to the Lord, Increase our faith.","But the Lord said, If you have faith like a mustard seed, you would have said to this sycamine tree, Be uprooted and be planted in the sea; and it would have obeyed you.","But which of you, having a slave who is plowing or tending sheep, will say to him when he has come in from the field, Come immediately and recline at table?","Will he not rather say to him, Prepare something that I may dine, and gird yourself and serve me until I eat and drink; and after that you will eat and drink?","He does not thank the slave because he did the things which were ordered, does he?","So also you, when you do all the things which are ordered you, say, We are unprofitable slaves; we have done what we ought to have done.","And as He was going to Jerusalem, He passed between Samaria and Galilee.","And as He entered into a certain village, ten leprous men, who stood at a distance, met Him.","And they raised their voice, saying, Jesus, Master, have mercy on us!","And when He saw them, He said to them, Go and show yourselves to the priests.

And he was a Samaritan.","And Jesus answered and said, Were not the ten cleansed? But the nine, where are they?","Were none found who returned to give glory to God except this foreigner?","And He said to him, Rise up and go; your faith has healed you.","And when He was questioned by the Pharisees as to when the kingdom of God was coming, He answered them and said, The kingdom of God does not come with observation;","Nor will they say, Behold, here it is! or, There! For behold, the kingdom of God is in the midst of you.","And He said to the disciples, The days will come when you will long to see one of the days of the Son of Man, and you will not see it.","And they will say to you, Behold, there! Behold, here! Do not go away, nor run after them.","For just as lightning flashing from one end of heaven shines to the other end of heaven, so will the Son of Man be in His day.","But first He must suffer many things and be rejected by this generation.","And even as it happened in the days of Noah, so will it be also in the days of the Son of Man:","They were eating, they were drinking, they were marrying, they were being given in marriage, until the day in which Noah entered into the ark and the flood came and destroyed them all.","Likewise, even as it happened in the days of Lot: they were eating, they were drinking, they were buying, they were selling, they were planting, they were building;","But on the day in which Lot went out from Sodom, it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all.","It will be in the same way on the day in which the Son of Man is revealed.","In that day, he who will be on the housetop and his goods in the house, let him not come down to take them away; and he who is in the field, likewise, let him not turn back to the things behind.","Remember Lot’s wife.","Whoever seeks to preserve his soul-life will lose it, and whoever loses it will preserve it alive.","I tell you, In that night there will be two on one bed; the one will be taken and the other will be left.","There will be two women grinding together; the one will be taken but the other will be left.","Two men will be in the field; one will be taken and the other will be left.","And they answered and said to Him, Where, Lord?

Nevertheless, when the Son of Man comes, will He find faith on the earth?","And He told this parable also to certain ones who trusted in themselves that they were righteous and despised the rest:","Two men went up to the temple to pray, the one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector.","The Pharisee stood and prayed these things to himself: God, I thank You that I am not like the rest of men\u00A0— extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even like this tax collector.","I fast twice a week; I give a tenth of all that I get.","But the tax collector, standing at a distance, would not even lift up his eyes to heaven, but beat his breast, saying, God, be propitiated to me, the sinner!","I tell you, This man went down to his house justified rather than that one; for everyone who exalts himself shall be humbled, but he who humbles himself shall be exalted.","And they were bringing to Him also their babies that He might touch them. But when the disciples saw this they rebuked them.","But Jesus called them to Him, saying, Allow the little children to come to Me, and do not forbid them, for of such is the kingdom of God.","Truly I say to you, Whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a little child shall by no means enter into it.","And a certain ruler questioned Him, saying, Good Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?","But Jesus said to him, Why do you call Me good? No one is good except One\u00A0— God.","You know the commandments: “Do not commit adultery, do not murder, do not steal, do not bear false witness, honor your father and mother.”","And he said, All these things I have kept from my youth.","And hearing this, Jesus said to him, Still you lack one thing: all that you have, sell and distribute to the poor, and you will have treasure in the heavens; and come, follow Me.","But when he heard these things, he became very sorrowful, for he was exceedingly rich.","And Jesus, seeing that he became very sorrowful, said, How difficult it is for those who have riches to go into the kingdom of God.","For it is easier for a camel to enter through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.","And those who heard said, Then who can be saved?","But He said, The things that are impossible with men are possible with God.","And Peter said, Behold, we have left our own things and have followed You.","And He said to them, Truly I say to you that there is no one who has left house or wife or brothers or parents or children for the sake of the kingdom of God,","Who shall not by all means receive back many times as much in this time, and in the coming age, eternal life.","And taking the twelve aside, He said to them, Behold we are going up to Jerusalem, and all things which have been written through the prophets regarding the Son of Man will be accomplished,","For He will be delivered up to the Gentiles and will be mocked and outrageously treated and spat upon;","And when they have scourged Him, they will kill Him; and on the third day He will rise.","And they understood none of these things, and this saying was hidden from them, and they did not know what was being said.","And as He drew near to Jericho, a certain blind man was sitting by the road, begging.","And hearing a crowd going by, he inquired what this might be.","And they told him that Jesus the Nazarene was passing by.","And he shouted, saying, Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!","And those going before rebuked him so that he would be silent, but he cried out much more, Son of David, have mercy on me!","And Jesus, standing still, commanded that he be led to Him. And when he drew near, He questioned him,","What do you want Me to do for you? And he said, Lord, that I may receive my sight!","And Jesus said to him, Receive your sight; your faith has healed you.","And instantly he received his sight and followed Him, glorifying God. And all the people, seeing it, gave praise to God."],["And He entered and was passing through Jericho.","And behold, there was a man whose name was called Zaccheus; and he was a chief tax collector, and he was rich.","And he was seeking to see Jesus, who He was, and could not because of the crowd, for he was small in stature.","And he ran on ahead and climbed up in a sycamore tree in order to see Him, for He was about to pass through that way.","And as He came to the place, Jesus looked up and said to him, Zaccheus, hurry and come down, for today I must stay in your house.","And he hurried and came down, and received Him, rejoicing.","And when they saw it, they all murmured, saying, He has gone in to lodge with a sinful man.","And Zaccheus stood and said to the Lord, Behold, the half of my possessions, Lord, I give to the poor, and if I have taken anything from anyone by false accusation, I restore four times as much.","And Jesus said to him, Today salvation has come to this house, because he also is a son of Abraham.","For the Son of Man has come to seek and to save that which is lost.","And as they were listening to these things, He spoke further a parable, because He was near Jerusalem and they supposed that the kingdom of God was to appear immediately.","He said therefore, A certain man of noble birth went to a distant country to receive for himself a kingdom and to return.","And he called ten of his own slaves and gave them ten minas, and he said to them, Do business until I come.","But his citizens hated him and sent an envoy after him, saying, We do not want this man to reign over us.","And when he came back, having received the kingdom, he commanded that those slaves to whom he had given the money should be called to him so that he might know what they had gained by doing business.","And the first appeared, saying, Master, your mina has gained ten minas.","And he said to him, Well done, good slave. Because you have become faithful in the least, have authority over ten cities.","And the second came, saying, Your mina, master, has made five minas.","And he said to this one as well, And you, be over five cities.","And the other came, saying, Master, behold your mina, which I kept laid away in a handkerchief;","For I was afraid of you, because you are a harsh man: you withdraw what you did not deposit, and you reap what you did not sow.","He said to him, Out of your mouth I will judge you, wicked slave. You knew that I am a harsh man, withdrawing what I did not deposit and reaping what I did not sow.","Why then did you not put my money in the bank, and when I came, I would have collected it with interest?","And to those standing by he said, Take the mina away from him, and give it to the one who has the ten minas.","And they said to him, Master, he has ten minas.","I tell you that to everyone who has, more shall be given, but from him who does not have, even that which he has shall be taken away.","However, these enemies of mine, who did not want me to reign over them, bring them here and slay them before me.","And having said these things, He went on before them, going up to Jerusalem.","And as He drew near to Bethphage and Bethany, near the mount which is called Olivet, He sent two of the disciples,","Saying, Go into the village opposite you, in which, as you are entering, you will find a colt tied, on which no man has ever yet sat; untie it and lead it here.","And if anyone asks you, Why are you untying it? thus shall you say, Because the Lord has need of it.","And those who were sent went away and found it even as He had told them.","And as they were untying the colt, its masters said to them, Why are you untying the colt?","And they said, Because the Lord has need of it.","And they brought it to Jesus. And when they had thrown their garments on the colt, they put Jesus on it.","And as He went, they spread their own garments in the road.","And as He was already drawing near to the descent of the Mount of Olives, all the multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the works of power which they had seen,","Saying, Blessed is the King who comes in the name of the Lord! Peace in heaven and glory in the highest!","And some of the Pharisees from the crowd said to Him, Teacher, rebuke Your disciples.","And He answered and said, I tell you, If these shall be silent, the stones will cry out.","And as He drew near, He saw the city and wept over it,","Saying, If you knew in this day, even you, the things that are for your peace! But now they have been hidden from your eyes.","For the days will come upon you when your enemies will throw up a rampart before you, and will encircle you, and will press you in on every side,","And they will level you to the ground and your children within you, and they will not leave a stone upon a stone in you, because you did not know the time of your visitation.","And He entered into the temple and began to cast out those who were selling,","Saying to them, It is written, “And My house shall be a house of prayer,” but you have made it a den of robbers.","And He taught daily in the temple. But the chief priests and the scribes and the leaders of the people sought to destroy Him;","Yet they could not find anything that they might do, for all the people were hanging upon Him, listening."],["And on one of the days, as He was teaching the people in the temple and announcing the good news, the chief priests and the scribes with the elders came upon Him,","And spoke, saying to Him, Tell us by what authority You do these things, or who is the one who gave You this authority?","And He answered and said to them, I also will ask you one thing, and you tell Me:","The baptism of John, was it from heaven or from men?","And they reasoned together among themselves, saying, If we say, From heaven, He will say, Why did you not believe him?","But if we say, From men, all the people will stone us to death, for they are persuaded that John was a prophet.","And they answered that they did not know where it was from.","And Jesus said to them, Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things.","And He began to speak to the people this parable: A certain man planted a vineyard and leased it out to vinedressers and went abroad for a considerable time.","And at the proper time he sent a slave to the vinedressers so that they might give him some of the fruit of the vineyard; but the vinedressers beat him and sent him away empty-handed.","And he went on to send another slave, but they beat that one also, and dishonored him, and sent him away empty-handed.","And he went on to send a third, but that one also they wounded and threw out.","And the master of the vineyard said, What shall I do? I will send my son, the beloved; they will probably respect this one.","But when the vinedressers saw him, they reasoned with one another, saying, This is the heir; let us kill him that the inheritance may become ours.","And they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. What then will the master of the vineyard do to them?","He will come and destroy these vinedressers and will give the vineyard to others. And when they heard this, they said, May it never happen!","But He looked at them, and said, What then is this that is written, “The stone which the builders rejected, this has become the head of the corner”?","Everyone who falls on that stone shall be broken to pieces; but on whomever it falls, it shall crush him to powder and scatter him like chaff.","And the scribes and the chief priests sought to lay hands on Him in that hour; yet they feared the people, for they perceived that it was with them in view that He spoke this parable.","And they watched Him closely and sent spies who feigned themselves to be righteous, in order that they might lay hold on some word of His, so as to deliver Him up to the rule and authority of the governor.","And they questioned Him, saying, Teacher, we know that You speak and teach correctly, and do not accept man’s person, but teach the way of God in truth.","Is it lawful for us to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?","But He perceived their craftiness and said to them,","Show Me a denarius. Whose image and inscription does it have? And they said, Caesar’s.","And He said to them, Therefore render the things that are Caesar’s to Caesar, and the things that are God’s to God.","And they were not able to lay hold of a saying of His in the presence of the people; and marveling at His answer, they kept silent.","And some of the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to Him and questioned Him,","Saying, Teacher, Moses wrote for us, If anyone’s brother has a wife and dies, and this one is childless, his brother should take the wife and raise up seed to his brother.","There were then seven brothers. And the first took a wife and died childless;","And the second;","And the third took her; and similarly the seven also did not leave children and died.","Finally the woman also died.","In the resurrection, therefore, which one’s wife does the woman become? For the seven had her as wife.","And Jesus said to them, The sons of this age marry and are given in marriage,","But those who are counted worthy to obtain that age and the resurrection from the dead neither marry nor are given in marriage;","For neither can they die anymore, for they are equal to angels, and they are sons of God, being sons of the resurrection.","But that the dead are raised, even Moses disclosed in the section concerning the thornbush, when he calls the Lord the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob.","Now He is not the God of the dead, but of the living, for to Him all men are living.","And some of the scribes answered and said, Teacher, You have spoken well.","For they no longer dared to question Him about anything.","And He said to them, How is it that they say that the Christ is David’s son?","For David himself says in the book of Psalms, “The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at My right hand,","Until I set Your enemies as a footstool for Your feet.”","David therefore calls Him Lord, and how is He his son?","And as all the people were listening, He said to His disciples,","Beware of the scribes, who like to walk around in long robes, and love greetings in the marketplaces and chief seats in the synagogues and places of honor at the dinners,","Who devour widows’ houses, and for a pretense make long prayers. These shall receive greater judgment."],["And He looked up and saw the rich casting their gifts into the treasury.","And He saw a certain impoverished widow casting there two lepta.","And He said, Truly I tell you that this poor widow has cast in more than all of them,","For all these out of their surplus have cast in something into the gifts, but she out of her lack has cast in all the living that she had.","And as some were speaking about the temple, that it was adorned with beautiful stones and consecrated offerings, He said,","As for these things which you are looking at, the days will come in which there will not be left a stone upon a stone which will not be thrown down.","And they questioned Him, saying, Teacher, when therefore will these things be? And what will be the sign when these things are about to take place?","And He said, See that you are not led astray, for many will come in My name, saying, I am the Christ! and, The time has drawn near! Do not go after them.","And when you hear of wars and revolutions, do not be terrified, for these things must take place first; but the end does not come immediately.","Then He said to them, Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom;","And there will be great earthquakes, and in various places famines and pestilences; and there will be terrors and great signs from heaven.","But before all these things they will lay their hands on you and persecute you, delivering you up to the synagogues and prisons, bringing you before kings and governors for the sake of My name.","It will turn out to you for a testimony.","Settle it therefore in your hearts not to take thought beforehand how to reply in defense,","For I will give you a mouth and wisdom which all those opposing you will not be able to resist or refute.","And you will be delivered up even by parents and brothers and relatives and friends, and they will put some of you to death.","And you will be hated by all because of My name,","Yet a hair of your head shall by no means perish.","In your endurance you will possess your souls.","But when you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, then know that her desolation has drawn near.","Then let those in Judea flee to the mountains, and let those in her midst get out, and let not those in the country enter into her,","Because these are days of vengeance, that all the things written may be fulfilled.","Woe to those who are pregnant and to those nursing babies in those days, for there will be great distress upon the land and wrath to this people.","And they will fall by the edge of the sword and will be led captive into all the nations; and Jerusalem will be trampled by the Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled.","And there will be signs in the sun and moon and stars, and upon the earth anguish of nations in perplexity at the roaring of the sea and the billows,","Men fainting from fear and expectation of the things coming upon the inhabited earth, for the powers of the heavens will be shaken.","And then they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.","And when these things begin to happen, stand erect and lift up your heads, because your redemption is drawing near.","And He told them a parable: Look at the fig tree and all the trees.","As soon as they sprout leaves, you see it and know of yourselves that the summer is already near.","So also you, when you see these things happening, know that the kingdom of God is near.","Truly I tell you that this generation shall by no means pass away until all things happen.","Heaven and earth shall pass away, but My words shall by no means pass away.","But take heed to yourselves lest perhaps your hearts be weighed down with debauchery and drunkenness and the anxieties of life, and that day come upon you suddenly as a snare.","For it will come in upon all those dwelling on the face of all the earth.","But be watchful at every time, beseeching that you would prevail to escape all these things which are about to happen and stand before the Son of Man.","Now during the day He was in the temple teaching, but during the night He went out and stayed on the mountain called Olivet.","And all the people would come early in the morning to Him in the temple to hear Him."],["Now the Feast of Unleavened Bread, which is called the Passover, was drawing near.","And the chief priests and the scribes were seeking a way to do away with Him, for they feared the people.","And Satan entered into Judas who was called Iscariot and was of the number of the twelve.","And he went away and conferred with the chief priests and officers as to how he might deliver Him up to them.","And they rejoiced and promised to give him money.","And he consented and sought opportunity to deliver Him up to them apart from the crowd.","And the day of Unleavened Bread came, on which the passover had to be sacrificed.","And He sent Peter and John, saying, Go and prepare the passover for us, so that we may eat it.","And they said to Him, Where do You want us to prepare it?","And He told them, Behold, as you are entering into the city, a man carrying an earthen jar of water will meet you. Follow him into the house which he enters.","And you shall say to the master of the house, The Teacher says to you, Where is the guest room where I may eat the passover with My disciples?","And that one will show you a large upper room furnished; prepare there.","And they left and found it even as He had told them, and they prepared the passover.","And when the hour came, He reclined at table, and the apostles with Him.","And He said to them, With desire I have desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer,","For I tell you that I shall by no means eat it until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God.","And He received a cup and gave thanks and said, Take this and divide it among yourselves;","For I tell you, I shall by no means drink from now on of the product of the vine until the kingdom of God comes.","And He took a loaf and gave thanks, and He broke it and gave it to them, saying, This is My body which is being given for you; do this in remembrance of Me.","And similarly the cup after they had dined, saying, This cup is the new covenant established in My blood, which is being poured out for you.","But behold, the hand of the one betraying Me is with Me at the table.","For the Son of Man is going according to what has been determined, but woe to that man through whom He is betrayed!","And they began to discuss among themselves who then of them it was who was about to do this.","And a contention also occurred among them as to which of them seemed to be greatest.","And He said to them, The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them, and those who have authority over them are called benefactors.","But you shall not be so; but let the greatest among you become like the youngest, and the one who leads like the one who serves.","For who is greater, the one who reclines at table or the one who serves? Is it not the one who reclines at table? But I am in your midst as the one who serves.","But you are those who have remained with Me throughout My trials.","And I appoint to you, even as My Father has appointed to Me, a kingdom,","That you may eat and drink at My table in My kingdom; and you will sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.","Simon, Simon, behold, Satan has asked to have you all to sift you as wheat.","But I have made petition concerning you that your faith would not fail; and you, once you have turned again, establish your brothers.","And he said to Him, Lord, I am ready to go with You both to prison and to death.","But He said, I tell you, Peter, a rooster will not crow today until you deny three times that you know Me.","And He said to them, When I sent you without purse and bag and sandals, you did not lack anything, did you?

And on the Sabbath they rested according to the commandment."],["Now on the first day of the week, at early dawn, they came to the tomb, bringing the spices which they had prepared.","And they found the stone rolled away from the tomb;","But when they entered, they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus.","And while they stood perplexed about this, behold, two men stood by them in dazzling clothing.","And they became frightened and bowed their faces to the ground, and the men said to them, Why are you seeking the living One among the dead?","He is not here but has been raised. Remember how He spoke to you while He was still in Galilee,","Saying that the Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men and be crucified and on the third day rise up.","And they remembered His words.","And returning from the tomb, they reported all these things to the eleven and to all the rest.","Now they were Mary the Magdalene and Joanna and Mary the mother of James and the rest of the women with them, who told these things to the apostles.","And these words appeared to them as nonsense, and they did not believe them.","But Peter rose up and ran to the tomb; and stooping to look in, he saw the linen cloths alone, and he went away to his own home, marveling at what had happened.","And behold, two of them were going on the same day to a village named Emmaus, which was sixty stadia away from Jerusalem.","And they were talking to each other concerning all these things which had occurred.","And while they were talking and discussing, Jesus Himself drew near and went with them.","But their eyes were kept from recognizing Him.","And He said to them, What are these words which you are exchanging with one another while you are walking? And they stood still, looking sad.","And one of them, Cleopas by name, answered and said to Him, Do You alone dwell as a stranger in Jerusalem and not know the things which have taken place in it in these days?","And He said to them, What things? And they said to Him, The things concerning Jesus the Nazarene, who was a Prophet powerful in work and word before God and all the people;","And how the chief priests and our rulers delivered Him up to the sentence of death and crucified Him.","But we were hoping that He was the One who was about to redeem Israel.

Being at the tomb early","And not finding His body, they came saying that they had also seen a vision of angels, who said that He is living.","And some of those with us went to the tomb and found it even as the women also said, but they did not see Him.","And He said to them, O foolish and slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken!","Was it not necessary for the Christ to suffer these things and enter into His glory?","And beginning from Moses and from all the prophets, He explained to them clearly in all the Scriptures the things concerning Himself.","And they drew near to the village where they were going, and He acted as though He would go farther.","And they constrained Him, saying, Stay with us, because it is near evening and the day is already gone by. And He went in to stay with them.","And as He reclined at table with them, He took the loaf and blessed it, and having broken it, He began handing it to them.","And their eyes were opened, and they recognized Him; and He disappeared from them.","And they said to one another, Was not our heart burning within us while He was speaking to us on the road, while He was opening to us the Scriptures?","And they rose up that very hour and returned to Jerusalem, and they found the eleven and those with them assembled together,","Saying, The Lord really has been raised and has appeared to Simon.","And they related the things that occurred on the road, and how He was made known to them in the breaking of the bread.","And as they were speaking these things, He Himself stood in their midst and said to them, Peace to you.","But they were terrified and became frightened and thought they beheld a spirit.","And He said to them, Why are you troubled, and why do doubts arise in your heart?","See My hands and My feet, that it is I Myself. Touch Me and see, for a spirit does not have flesh and bones as you behold Me having.","And when He had said this, He showed them His hands and His feet.","And while they still did not believe for joy and were marveling, He said to them, Do you have anything here to eat?","And they handed Him a piece of broiled fish;","And He took it and ate before them.","And He said to them, These are My words which I spoke to you while I was still with you, that all the things written in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and Psalms concerning Me must be fulfilled.","Then He opened their mind to understand the Scriptures;","And He said to them, Thus it is written, that the Christ would suffer and rise up from the dead on the third day,","And that repentance for forgiveness of sins would be proclaimed in His name to all the nations, beginning from Jerusalem.","You are witnesses of these things.","And behold, I send forth the promise of My Father upon you; but as for you, stay in the city until you put on power from on high.","And He led them out as far as Bethany, and He lifted up His hands and blessed them.","And while He blessed them, He parted from them and was carried up into heaven.","And they worshipped Him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy,","And were continually in the temple, blessing God."]]
